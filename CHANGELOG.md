* Fix a bug where hovering over a drop zone with a consumable/material stack and waiting for the message to turn green still wouldn't trigger the partial move dialog.
* Added a new "Item Leveling" auto-loadout. This loadout finds items for you to dump XP into. It strongly favors locked items, and won't replace an incomplete item that you have equipped. Otherwise, it goes after items that already have the most XP (closest to completion), preferring exotics and legendaries if they are locked, and rares and legendaries if they're not locked (because you get more materials out of disassembling them that way).

* Pressing the "i" key on the keyboard will toggle showing item details in the item popup.
* Add a menu item for when Xur is in town. This brings up a panel with Xur's wares, how much everything costs, how many strange coins you have, and lets you show the item details popup plus compare against any version of exotics you might already have to see if there's a better roll.

# 3.5

* DIM will now go to great lengths to make sure your transfer will succeed, even if your target's inventory is full, or the vault is full. It does this by moving stuff aside to make space, automatically.
* Fixed a bug that would cause applying loadouts to fill up the vault and then fail.
* Fixed a bug where DIM would refuse to equip an exotic when dequipping something else, even if the exotic was OK to equip.
* When applying a loadout, DIM will now equip and dequip loadout items all at once, in order to speed up applying the loadout.

# 3.4.1

* Bugfix to address an infinite loop while moving emotes.

# 3.4.0

* Moving and equipping items, especially many at a time (loadouts) is faster.
* When you save a loadout, it is now scoped to the platform it's created on, rather than applying across accounts. Loadouts created on one account used to show on both accounts, but wouldn't work on the wrong account.
* You can now move partial amounts of materials. There's a slider in the move popup, and holding "shift" or hovering over the drop area will pop up a dialog for draggers. You can choose to move more than one stack's worth of an item, up to the total amount on a character.
* New commands for materials to consolidate (move them all to this character) and distribute (divide evenly between all characters).
* Loadouts can now contain materials and consumables. Add or remove 5 at a time by holding shift while clicking. When the loadout is applied, we'll make sure your character has *at least* that much of the consumable.
* Loadouts can now contain 10 weapons or armor of a single type, not just 9.
* When making space for a loadout, we'll prefer putting extra stuff in the vault rather than putting it on other characters. We'll also prefer moving aside non-equipped items of low rarity and light level.
* The is:engram search filter actually works.
* Fixed an error where DIM would not replace an equipped item with an instance of the same item hash. This would cause an error with loadouts and moving items. [448](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/448)
* Loadouts can now display more than one line of items, for you mega-loadout lovers.
* Items in the loadout editor are sorted according to your sort preference.

* The infusion auto calculator runs automatically, and now presents a list of different attack/defense values for you to choose from. Selecting one will show the best path to get to that light level.
* The infusion calculator greys out items that are already used or are too low light to use, rather than hiding them.
* The item move popup now has an entry for the infusion calculator, to make it easier to find.
* Hold Shift and click on items in the infusion calculator to prevent the calculator from using that item.
* If you have an exotic class item (with "The Life Exotic" perk) equipped, you can now equip another exotic without having the class item get automatically de-equipped. Previously, this worked only if you equipped the non-class-item exotic first.
* Armor, Artifacts, and Ghosts now show the difference in stats with your currently equipped item. Also, magazine/energy between swords and other heavy weapons compares correctly.
* The is:complete, is:incomplete, is:upgraded, is:xpincomplete, and is:xpcomplete search keywords all work again, and their meanings have been tweaked so they are all useful.
* The talent grid for an item are now shown in the item details, just like in the game, including XP per node.
* Subclasses show a talent grid as well!
* The item stats comparison will no longer be cleared if DIM reloads items while an item popup is open.
* Bounties and quests are now separated, and under their own "Progress" heading.
* Bounties, quests, and anything else that can have objectives (like test weapons and runes) now show their objectives and the progress towards them. As a result, completion percentages are also now accurate for those items.
* Descriptions are now shown for all items.
* Include hidden stats "Aim Assist" and "Equip Speed" for all weapons. You can still see all hidden stats by visiting DTR via the link at the top of item details.

* You can now create a loadout based on what you've got equipped by selecting "From Equipped" in the "Create Loadout" menu item.
* After applying a loadout, a new pseudo-loadout called "Before 'Your Loadout'" appears that will put back the items you had equipped.

# 3.2

* In the "Loadouts" dropdown is a new "Maximize Light" auto-loadout that does what it says, pulling items from all your characters and the vault in order to maximize your character's light.
* Lots of performance improvements! Loading DIM, refreshing, moving items, and searching should all be faster.
* DIM will now refresh immediately when you switch back to its tab, or come back from screensaver, etc. It won't automatically update when it's in the background anymore. It still periodically updates itself when it is the focused tab.
