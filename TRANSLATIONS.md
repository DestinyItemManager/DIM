# Supported Languages
Due to what information is provided by Bungie about item names and descriptions the following languages are the only languages that will be supported by DIM:
  - English
  - French
  - German
  - Italian
  - Japanese
  - Portuguese (BR)
  - Spanish

# Translating DIM

We use [Angular translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/guide/02_getting-started) for all our translated strings, so if you want to translate something that's currently English-only, take a look at that. Usually it's as simple as replacing some text with `<span translate="KEY"></span>` and then defining KEY in the i18n file. Within code, you need to use the `$translate` service - see `dimStoreService` for an example.

There are two different roles available per language


| Role 	| Responsibilities |
|-------|------------------|
| Translators | Provide Translations |
| Reviewers   | Provide Translations and verify translations of others |

# Translators
[Getting Started](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started/translators)

[Translating with the Web Editor](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor)

*Translations are not considered complete, until they have been reviewed by at least 1 reviewer.

[Plural/Select Help](http://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/editor.html)
If you need help with the correct Plural or Select string open this page up and copy/paste the string you are translating into it.

# Reviewers
[Reviewing Strings](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/reviewing-strings)

#Raising Issues/Comments
If a translation is wrong ensure you tag someone or comment as an issue.
If you just apply a comment stating something is wrong, the only way someone would see it is if they were reading all the comments on all the keys.
