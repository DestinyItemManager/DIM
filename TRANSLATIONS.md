  - English
  - French
  - German
  - Italian
  - Japanese
  - Portuguese (BR)
  - Spanish
 

#Translating DIM

We use [Angular translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/guide/02_getting-started) for all our translated strings, so if you want to translate something that's currently English-only, take a look at that. Usually it's as simple as replacing some text with `<span translate="KEY"></span>` and then defining KEY in the i18n file. Within code, you need to use the `$translate` service - see `dimStoreService` for an example.
