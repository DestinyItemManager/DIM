  // what's averageNonZeroStatWeight for?
  // we want the effect of all the non-zero multipliers to average out to 1x
  // like STR x 1 / DIS x 2 / MOB x 3 --- to do this --- STR x .5 / DIS x 1 / MOB x 1.5

  // this way, you can exclude a stat by setting it to 0 (which will reduce your total), but
  // among *included* stats, there's no overall bias toward creating higher or lower total,
  // except of course when the item has better values in preferred (heavily weighted) stats

  // also, this way, a weighting that's just 1x's and 0x's, becomes simply
  // "include these" and "exclude these" which is how original custom total works

  // as you make weighting more and more lopsided, the highest weighted stat
  // approaches 2x, and the lowers approach 0, SO: a custom total should top out around
  // the single stat max (42 base) times a 2x weighting multiplier. let's just call it 100
