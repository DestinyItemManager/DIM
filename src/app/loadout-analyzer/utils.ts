 * Returns `mergedConstraintsImplyStrictUpgrade` iff every valid set in the
 * merged constraints is also always a strict upgrade, so that we don't have to
 * ask the process worker for strict upgrades on top of that.
 *
 * This also maps the stat constraints into the DesiredStatRange format, which
