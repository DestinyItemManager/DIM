                  In order to display and manipulate Destiny game information, DIM uses the
                  Bungie.net API. You must grant permission for DIM to use this API through
                  Bungie.net. The only information DIM receives, or has access to, is your game
                  information (items, characters, etc.) and basic account information including your
                  Bungie.net membership ID, and the identifiers of any linked services such as your
                  public PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, Stadia, Blizzard or Bungie.net usernames. We do not
                  have access to your email, name, address, payment information, or any other
                  personal information held by Bungie or the game platforms.

                  DIM only stores your Destiny and Bungie information locally on your own device and
                  in memory, in order to provide DIM's functionality. We do not store any of this
                  information anywhere that the DIM maintainers and contributors can access it.

                  DIM allows you to connect to DIM Sync, a cloud service operated by the DIM team,
                  in order to store your data and sync it between instances of DIM or other Destiny
                  apps. This information is only accessible to you and the DIM team. Information
                  stored in DIM Sync includes your DIM preferences and settings, loadouts, any
                  per-item item tags and notes, saved and recently used search filters, and a
                  history of actions performed in DIM Sync (e.g. when you change a tag or save a
                  loadout). Your Bungie.net authentication information is sent to DIM Sync only in
                  order to verify your account - it is not saved.
