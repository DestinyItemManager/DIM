    <h1>Supporting DIM</h1>
    <div class="ngdialog-inner-content">
        <p>DIM is a product that is free to download and use. The source code for DIM is open sourced, and free to anyone to enhance. You will never see an ad in DIM. That is our commitment.</p>
        <p>We're all huge fans of Destiny. DIM came to life in those hours of gameplay because we felt that pain of transferring gear between characters and forgetting that one item, or trips down to the tower to unload your ROC strikes. DIM is the tool that will help you get more gametime.</p>
