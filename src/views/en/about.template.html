        <h3><a href="$DIM_CHANGELOG" target="_blank">Version $DIM_VERSION</a></h3>
        <p>DIM is built upon the same services used by Bungie.net and the Destiny Companion App. DIM can access the items within your Guardians inventory and the Vault for both PlayStation and Xbox. You then can drag and drop items anywhere you wish to move them.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div>
            <dl>
<dt>How does DIM get access to my Destiny data?</dt>
                <dd>Any chrome extension can ask for the data a website stores on your computer. When you log into Bungie.net, you are given a token (a cookie) that is generated uniquely for your account. You use this token to communicate with Bungie securely. The token is more secure than sending your username and password with each request to Bungie's server. DIM uses this token to communicate with Bungie on your behalf.</dd>
            </dl>
<dl>
<dt>How can I log out of DIM?</dt>
                <dd>Your session is tied to Bungie.net. If you logout on Bungie.net, you're effectively logged out of DIM.</dd>
            </dl>
<dl>
<dt>Does DIM support keyboard shortcuts?</dt>
                <dd>Yes! Press "?" to see a list of available shortcuts.</dd>
            </dl>

<dt>I lost my item using your tool!</dt>
                <dd>More than likely a transfer failed, leaving your item in the vault or on another character. You could search for the item. If that doesn't turn it up, refresh the app by pressing F5. Check <a href="https://www.bungie.net" target="_blank">Bungie.net</a> or in game to see if your item still exists. We're sure it's still there.</dd>
