<li>Localization updates.</li>
<li>Fixed objective text in the record book floating above stuff.</li>
<li>Fixed displaying record objectives that are time-based as time instead of just a number of seconds.</li>

<li>Loadout Builder no longer has equip and create loadout buttons for loadouts that include vendor items.</li>

<li>DIM has a new logo!</li>

<li>See community weapon ratings in DIM, and submit your own! Weapon ratings can be turned on in Settings, and will show up on your individual weapons as well as in the details popup. You can submit your own reviews - each review is specific to the weapon roll you're looking at, so you know whether you've got the god roll.</li>
