<!--<h1>Welcome Guardian.</h1>

<p>Destiny Item Manager is here to help you become a more powerful Guardian.</p>

<p>The first step is for you to allow DIM to know more about your characters, vault, and items in Destiny.  We also need permission to move your items in Destiny.</p>

<button>Authorize DIM with Bungie.net</button>

<p>A Bungie.net account that is linked to either a PlayStation or Microsoft account is required. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12130" target="_blank">Learn more about Bungie.net accounts, and linking your PlayStation and Xbox Accounts.</a></p>
