      "FAQD2Answer": "Yes! We expect to support Destiny 2 shortly after it's launched (and we've had a chance to play the game ourselves). Expect DIM to start with the easy stuff (showing and moving your items) and working up to cooler features as we all discover what D2 has in store for us. The same DIM website will support Destiny 2 and Destiny 1 at the same time, and you'll be able to switch back and forth between your D1 and D2 characters.",
