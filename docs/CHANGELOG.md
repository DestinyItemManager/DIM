## Next

* Bounties and Quests sections on the Progress page now show a summary of bounties by their requirement - weapon, location, activity, and element. Click on a weapon type to pull a weapon matching that type.
* New item sort option to sort sunset items last.

### Beta Only

* A new "Single character mode" can be enabled through settings, or the Â« icon on desktop. This focuses down to a single character, and merges your other characters' inventories into the vault (they're really still on the other characters, we're just displaying them different). This is intended for people who are focused on one character, and always shows the last played character when collapsed.
* Pinnacle/powerful rewards show a more accurate bonus, taking into account your current max power.

## 6.40.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-11-22)</span>

* Mod and mod slot info in Loadout Optimizer have been updated to handle the new mod slots better.
* Postmaster items can be dragged over any items on your character to transfer them - they don't need to be dragged to the matching item type.
* Stop showing extra +3 stats on masterwork weapons. The fix for this means that Adept weapons may not show that bonus when they are released.
* Progress page now shows more Milestones/Challenges, shows rewards for all of them, includes vendor pictures where available, and gives a hint as to what power pinnacle/powerful engrams can drop at.

## 6.39.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-11-16)</span>

* Farming mode will no longer immediately kick out items you manually move onto your character.

## 6.39.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-11-15)</span>

* Xur's location is now shown on his entry in the Vendors page.
* The Raids section is back in Progress, and Garden of Salvation shows up in Milestones.
* Search autocomplete suggests the `current` and `next` keywords for seasons.
* Reworked mod handling to account for new legacy and combat mod slots. New searches include `holdsmod:chargedwithlight`, `holdsmod:warmindcell`, etc., and `modslot:legacy` and `modslot:combatstyle`.
* Armor tiles now display the energy capacity of the armor.
* Masterwork levels in the mod details menu once again show which level masterwork they are.
* Added a new sort order for items, sort by Seasonal icon.
* Darkened the item actions sidecar to improve contrast with the background.
* Fixed a visual glitch where the tagging menu looked bad.
* Fixed logic for determining what can be pulled from postmaster to exclude stacked items like Upgrade Modules when you cannot actually pull any more of them.

* Loadout drawer, Compare, Farming, and Infusion now work on every page that shows an item from your inventory.
* Deleting a loadout from the loadout drawer now closes the loadout drawer.
* When Bungie.net is not returning live perk information, we won't show the default perks anymore.

### Beta Only

* Preview of "Active Mode", an in-progress new view that focuses down to a single character plus your vault, and has easy access to pursuits, farming, max light, and more.

## 6.38.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-11-11)</span>

* Removed character gender from tiles and notifications.
* Don't show empty archetype bar for items in collections.
* Deprecated the `sunsetsafter` search filter because its meaning is unclear. Introduced the `sunsetsin` filter and the `is:sunset` filter.
  * Try out `sunsetsin:hunt` for weapons which reached their power cap in season 11.
  * `is:sunset` won't show anything until Beyond Light launches!
* Added `current` and `next` as season names for searches. Search `sunsetsin:next` to see what'll be capped in next season even before it has an official name.
* Vendorengrams.xyz integration has been removed, because of the vendor changes in Beyond Light.
* Legacy Triumphs have been removed.
* Fixed the Progress page not loading.

* Fixed not being able to scroll on mobile.
* Fixed filter help not always showing up.

## 6.37.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-11-01)</span>

* Removed "Color Blind Mode" setting. This didn't help with DIM's accessibility - it just put a filter over the page to *simulate what it would be like* if you had various forms of color blindness.
* Added `hunt` as valid season synonym.
* Clicking on the energy track or element for armor can now let you preview how much it'd cost in total to upgrade energy or change element.

* Made the item popup a bit thinner.
* Collapsing sections now animate open and closed.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with a new "Search Results" sheet that shows all the items matching your search in one place.

## 6.35.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-10-18)</span>

* Added the "sidecar" for item popup actions on desktop. This lets us have more actions, and they're easier to understand. If you always use drag and drop, you can collapse the sidecar down into a smaller version.
* On mobile, press and hold on an item to access a quick actions menu, then drag your finger to an option and release to execute it. Move items faster than ever before!
* Added buttons to the settings page to restore the default wish list URL.
* Tweaked the Loadout Optimizer to make it easier to understand, and more clearly highlight that stats can be dragged to reorder them.
* In Loadout Optimizer, Compare Loadout can now compare with your currently equipped gear. Also, clicking "Save Loadout" will prompt you for whether you want to overwrite the loadout you're comparing with.
* Fixed an issue where you couldn't directly edit the minimum power field in Loadout Optimizer.
* D1 items can no longer incorrectly offer the ability to pull from postmaster.

## 6.34.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-10-11)</span>

* Replaced the tagging dropdown with a nicer one that shows the icon and keyboard shortcut hints.
* Made the farming mode popup on mobile not overlap the category selector, and made it smaller.

* In the Organizer, the selected perk for multi-option perks is now bold.
* Updated the style and tooltip for wishlist perks to match the thumb icon shown on tiles.

* Fixed character stats only displaying the current character's stats on mobile.
* Fixed Postmaster not appearing on D1 for mobile.

## 6.32.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-27)</span>

* In Compare, you can click on perks to see what the new stats would look like if you chose another option.
* When the item popup is open, hitting the "c" key will open Compare.
* Your subclass has been moved below weapons and armor (it's been this way in Beta for a while).
* On mobile, instead of showing all your items at once, there's now a category selection bar that lets you quickly swap between weapons, armor, etc. The postmaster is under "inventory".
* Transferring items is just a touch snappier.
* The tag and compare button on the search bar have been replaced with a dropdown menu (three dots) with a lot more options for things you can do with the items that match your search.
* On mobile, your equipped emblem no longer affects the color of your screen.

* Fix masterwork stats not always highlighting.
* Fix masterwork tier for some items.
* Fix an issue where searching for "ote" wouldn't suggest "note:"
* The Organizer shows up in the mobile menu, but it just tells you to turn your phone.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with moving the item action buttons to the side of the item popup on desktop - we call it the "sidecar". It moves the actions closer to the mouse, allows room to have clearer labels, and gives more room to add more commands. Plus generally people have screens that are wider than they are tall, so this reduces the height of the popup which could previously put buttons off screen. We'll be tweaking this for a while before it launches fully.
* Beta now has an early preview of a new theme for DIM.

## 6.31.2 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-22)</span>

## 6.31.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-20)</span>

* Added a link to the DIM User Guide to the hamburger menu.
* "Clear new items" has been moved into the Settings page instead of being a floating button. The "X" keyboard shortcut no longer clears new items.
* Linear Fusion rifles are technically Fusion Rifles, but they won't show up in Organizer or in searches under Fusion Rifle anymore.
* While API performance is ultimately up to Bungie, we've changed things around in DIM to hopefully make item transfers snappier. Note that these changes mean you may see outdated information in DIM if you've deleted or vaulted items in-game and haven't clicked the refresh button in DIM.
* Improved the autocomplete for `sunsetsafter:` searches.

* The D1 Activities page now shows Challenge of the Elders completion.

* When "Base Stats" is checked in the Compare tool, clicking on stats will sort by base stat, not actual stat.

### Beta Only

* On mobile, there is now a bar to quickly swap between different item categories on the inventory screen.

## 6.30.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-13)</span>

* Compare loadouts in Loadout Optimizer to your existing loadout by clicking the "Compare Loadout" button next to a build.
* Improvements to search performance, and search autocomplete suggestions.

* Sword-specific stats now show up in `stat:` filters.

## 6.29.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-11)</span>

* Improved performance of item transfers. We're still limited by how fast Bungie.net's API can go, though.
* Fixed a couple of the legacy triumphs that indicated the wrong triumph was being retired.
* Completed legacy triumph categories, and collections categories, now show the "completed" yellow background.
* is:seasonaldupe now correctly pays attention to the season of the item.
* Fixed a bug where notes wouldn't be saved if you clicked another item before dismissing the item popup.

## 6.29.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-09-10)</span>

* Triumphs, Collections, and Stat Trackers are now all together in the new Records page.
* You can track triumphs in DIM - tracked triumphs are stored and synced with DIM Sync. These show up on both the Progress and Records pages.
* Everything on the Records page responds to search - search through your Collections, Triumphs, and Stat Trackers all at once!
* Unredeemed triumphs show their rewards
* Compare sheet now offers a Base Stat option for armor, so you can directly compare your stat rolls
* Mod costs now shown in Loadout Optimizer results
* Vendors can now track some "pluggable" items like emotes & ghost projections, to filter by whether you already own them

## 6.27.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-30)</span>

* The new armor 2.0 mod workflow is available in the Loadout Optimizer, this includes:
  * A new Mod Picker component to let you choose armor 2.0 mods to lock.
  * The mod sockets shown in the optimiser are now the locked mods, rather than the mods currently equipped on the item.
  * Clicking on a mod socket will open the picker to show available mods for that slot. Note that locking a mod from this won't guarantee it gets locked to the item specifically.
  * Items have different levels of grouping depending on the requirements of the locked mods. Locking no mods keeps the previous grouping behaviour.
  * The mods stat contributions are now shown in the picker.
  * The Mod Picker can now filter for items from a specific season, just filter by the season number directly e.g. "11" for arrivals.
* The search bar now remembers your past searches and allows you to save your favorite searches. These saved and recent searches are synced between devices using DIM Sync.
* The quick item picker (plus icon) menu no longer has an option to equip the selected item. Instead it will always just move the item - very few users selected "Equip" and it won't ever work in game activities.
* Added background colors for items and characters before their images load in, which should reduce the "pop-in" effect.
* Shaders can be tagged from the Collections page and the tags/notes show up there as well.
* Shift+Click on the Notes field in Organizer while in edit mode no longer applies a search.
* For pages with sidebars (like Progress), scrollbars appearing will no longer cover content.

## 6.26.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-23)</span>

* Better touchscreen support for drag and drop.
* Wishlists now support Github gists (raw text URLs), so there's no need to set up an entire repository to host them. If you are making wishlists, you can try out changes easier than ever. If you're not making wishlists, hopefully you're using them. If you don't know what wishlists are, [here you go](https://destinyitemmanager.fandom.com/wiki/Wish_Lists)
* Engrams get a more form-fitting outline on mouse hover.
* If you have a search query active, DIM will not automatically reload to update itself.

## 6.24.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-12)</span>

* Updated the character tiles, now uses triple dot instead of chevron
* Solstice of Heroes is back and so is the **Solstice of Heroes** section of the **Progress** tab. Check it out and view your progress toward upgrading armor.

## 6.24.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-09)</span>

* Configure a custom armor stat per-class in Settings, and it'll show up in item popups, Organizer, Compare, and the new `stat:custom:` search.

* `is:smg` for if you're as bad at remembering "submachine gun" as.. some of us are.

* Seasonal Artifact is now previewable, but be warned:
  * Some data from the API is wrong, and the Season 11 artifact is incorrectly labeled.
  * It can show seasonal mods you have equipped, but Season 11 mods still aren't in Collections data, so mod unlocks aren't displayed.
* Spreadsheet columns slightly adjusted to get them back to their usual column names.
* Lots going on behind the scenes to clear up errors and get Loadout Optimizer ready for upgrades!

## 6.23.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-08-02)</span>

* You can add tags and notes to shaders! Keep track of your favorites and which shaders you could do without.
* Searches now support parentheses for grouping, the "and" keyword, and the "not" keyword. Example: `(is:weapon and is:sniperrifle) or not (is:armor and modslot:arrival)`. "and" has higher precedence than "or", which has higher precedence than just a space (which still means "and").
* Fixed the size of damage type icons in D1.
* Our Content Security Policy is more restrictive now, external and injected scripts may fail but this keeps your account and data safer.

## 6.22.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-07-27)</span>

## 6.17.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-06-28)</span>

## 6.15.1 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-06-15)</span>

## 6.15.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-06-14)</span>

## 6.13.0 <span className="changelog-date">(2020-05-31)</span>

* CSV export will no longer erroneously consider calus as a source and instead output the correct source.
* CSV export will now export the same source information that DIM uses for items that do not have a source in the API.

* Introducing [DIM Sync](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/wiki/DIM-Sync-(new-storage-for-tags,-loadouts,-and-settings)), a brand new way for DIM to store your loadouts and tags and sync them between all your devices.

Plus, you no longer have to log into anything separate, and we should avoid some of the bugs that have in the past led to lost data.
