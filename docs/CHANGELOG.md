## 7.8.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-06)</span>

### Changes

* The "Pull From Postmaster" button no longer requires a second tap to confirm. For those who dislike this button, it may be removed entirely via a setting in the Settings page.
* Removed D2Gunsmith link from the item details popup while they work on revamping the site for all the new changes.
* Removed the `level:` filter for D2 accounts, as Guardians no longer have a Level and items no longer require one.
* Season of the Risen War Table Upgrades are now in the right order and show their acquired status.
* Loadout Optimizer Mod picker will now correctly update when switching between mod slots without closing Mod Picker.
* Loadout Optimizer now correctly takes Echo of Persistence's class-specific stat reductions into account when generating sets.
* The "Kinetic Slot" icon in Compare sheet now looks different from the "Kinetic Damage" icon.

### Features

* `is:wishlistunknown` highlights items that have no rolls in the currently loaded wishlist.
* When you have 10 or more loadouts, a search box will appear in the Inventory page loadout dropdown, allowing you to search names just like on the Loadouts page.
* The Item Feed is available on both desktop and mobile. It shows your gear in the order it dropped, and gives you quick controls to tag incoming loot. Click on the item tile to get the full item popup.
  * Item Feed also got better at identifying relevant weapon perks.
  * Tagging an item from the Item Feed also marks it as not-new.
  * Items can be dragged out of the feed into inventory locations (or into the loadout editor).
* We have brand new Loadout Editor! Check it out from the character menu or the Loadouts page.
  * The layout mirrors the Loadout page's new design which has clear areas for different types of items. Each section also has a menu of additional actions like re-syncing from your currently equipped items, or clearing out a whole section.
  * As part of this change, we're removing support for "multi-class" loadouts. Loadouts will either be tied to one class, or can be toggled to "Any Class". "Any Class" loadouts cannot contain Subclass, Armor, or Fashion. If you edit an existing "Any Class" loadout and save it, those items will be removed unless you turn off "Any Class".
  * Double-click items to toggle between equipped and unequipped instead of single clicking. We'll be continuing to improve how you choose items and specify whether they're equipped in the future.
  * A new setting allows you to clear out all other mods from your armor when applying a loadout. This works even if you've chosen no mods in your loadout, so you can make a "Reset mods" loadout.
  * With this new design we have space to add even more loadout editing tools over the next few seasons.
  * The loadout editor stays open if you navigate to the Inventory or Loadouts screen while it's already open.
  * The new Loadout Editor is not available for D1.

### Witch Queen updates

* The Organizer page now includes a selector for Glaives.
* Glaives now show their Shield Duration stat.
* New search filters:
  * `deepsight:complete` and `deepsight:incomplete` to check the status of weapons' Deepsight attunement.
  * `deepsight:ruinous`, `deepsight:adroit`, `deepsight:mutable` and `deepsight:energetic` to identify Deepsight Resonance weapons that can provide specific Resonant Elements.
  * `is:craftable` for any weapons which could be crafted at the Relic.
  * `weaponlevel:` to filter by a crafted weapon's level.
  * `is:glaive` ... finds Glaives!

* If your loadout includes ornaments, items are shown as if they had the loadout applied in the loadout page and loadout editor.
* You can now change the Aeon sect mod through the item popup.

* Loadout Optimizer is now a little more thorough in preventing an item from being both pinned and excluded.

### Beta Only

  * This works around a Bungie API issue, and will allow users to select and try equipping Stasis Aspects they have not unlocked, which may result in failures applying loadouts, if the aspects are not unlocked.

  * Fixed an error when applying mod loadouts to armor too old to have mod energy.

### Beta Only

* We're trying out a new tool for the desktop inventory screen called "Item Feed". Click the tab on the right to pop out a feed of your item drops with quick buttons to tag them. By default tagged items disappear from the view so you can focus on new stuff.

## 6.96.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-12-19)</span>

* Loadouts now show correct stats for subclass, item, and mod selections. All mods are accounted for whether they actually will fit or not.

* Fix image paths for D1 perks.

* Ability Cooldown times are no longer shown for stat tooltips. This may return but at the moment, they were incorrect.
* Added 'source:30th' for items coming from the Bungie 30th Anniversary.

### Loadouts
* Stasis subclass abilities, aspects, and fragments are now displayed in the loadouts page.
* When displaying mod placement in Loadouts, if an armor slot has no item in the loadout, the character's current armor piece will be used.
* Removed the "Max Power" loadout from the loadouts page. You can still apply it from the loadout menu on the inventory screen.
* If loadouts have notes, those notes are now displayed in the hover text on the loadout dropdown
* Artifice Armor mod slots are now handled in Loadouts and the Loadout Optimizer.
* Hitting +Equipped in the loadout editor will add current mods.
* Creating a new loadout from equipped items will also save your subclass configuration.

### Loadout Optimizer

* Fix an issue where energy swaps in the Optimizer where not displaying the correct resulting energy.

### Mod Plugging Capabilities
* Bungie has enabled the API capabilities to apply armor mods, toggle weapon perks, and perform other plugging-in type operations. So now you can take advantage of these features of DIM!
  * This works from the item popup, and when applying loadouts that contain mods.
  * DIM can apply weapon perks, armor mods, shaders, weapon & exotic ornaments, and Stasis Aspects and Fragments.
  * It cannot apply weapon mods, which still cost glimmer in the game.
  * It can't yet apply transmog/Synthesis ornaments, but Bungie is working on addressing this.
  * Swapping Stasis aspects & fragments via loadouts is coming soon.

### Mods in Loadouts
* When you apply a loadout with armor mods, DIM will automatically assign these among armor pieces.
* If there's no armor in the loadout, it will apply these mods to your character's current pieces.
* More specific/custom placement options are in the works.
* DIM will not clear off existing mods except to make room for requested ones.

### Plugging-Related Fixes
* Fix a bug that prevented applying shaders or ornaments from the item popup.
* Fix emblems and subclasses not applying from loadouts.
* The mod picker launched from the item popup or Loadout Optimizer will now correctly show the mods unlocked by the applicable character, rather than across all characters. This helps a lot with artifact mods where you may have different ones unlocked on different characters. Note that this also means opening the mod picker for items in the vault will show no artifact mods unlocked - move the item to a character if you want to apply that mod.
* Vendor items no longer offer to apply perks.

## 6.94.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-12-05)</span>

* You can change perks and slot zero-cost mods from the item Popup.

  * This will not work until the 30th Anniversary patch.
  * Applying mods will also strip off any mods that aren't in your loadout from your equipped armor.
  * Mods will be placed on your equipped armor whether that armor came from your loadout or not.
* Loadouts can now have notes.
* Share loadout build settings (mods, notes, loadout optimizer settings) from the Loadouts page.
* Loadouts can now save stasis subclass abilities, aspects, and fragments. These do not yet get applied when applying a loadout.
* We made several bugfixes to how loadouts are applied that should fix some issues where not all items got equipped or failures were shown when nothing failed.
* The "Create Loadout" button on the Loadouts page defaults the loadout to match the class of the selected character.
* The menu for pinning or excluding an item in Loadout Optimizer now only shows items that match the overall search filter.
* Stat searches support keywords like "highest" and "secondhighest" in stat total/mean expressions. e.g. basestat:highest&secondhighest:>=17.5

## 6.93.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-28)</span>

* Steam browser is officially unsupported, and we now show a banner explaining that.
* However, we have managed to fix DIM so it doesn't crash loop in the Steam overlay. Until the next time Steam updates...
* Loadout Optimizer performance has been improved significantly - so much so that we now always look at all possible combinations of armor. Previously we trimmed some items out to get below an a number that we could process in time. This means that your LO builds are now guaranteed to be optimal, and the "Max" range shown in the stat tiles will always be accurate.
* We no longer cap stats in the Loadout Optimizer's tooltips so you can see how far over 100 a stat goes.
* Fixed a bug where Loadout Optimizer would only show one set.
* Cryptolith Lure and Firewall Data Fragment have been moved from "Quests" to "Quest Items".
* We've launched a new Loadouts page that makes it easy to browse through your loadouts. The Loadout Optimizer is accessible from that page. Also, loadouts are now by default sorted by when they were last edited, rather than their name. You can change this on the Loadouts page or in settings.
* Some perks in the Armory view that showed as not rolling on the current version of an item now correctly show that they can roll.

## 6.92.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-23)</span>

* Fixed "Optimize Armor" button (formerly "Open in Loadout Optimizer") in the loadout drawer.

## 6.92.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-21)</span>

* Show bars next to armor stats in Compare.
* At long last, found and fixed a bug that could lead to tags and notes getting wiped if you switched accounts while another account's data was loading. Many apologies to anyone who lost their tags and notes from this bug, and we hope it's gone for good.
* Remove bright engram rewards from prestige season pass rewards as these were guesses and not quite right.

### Beta Only

* We're testing out a new Loadouts page that makes it easy to browse through your loadouts. The Loadout Optimizer is accessible from that page. Also, loadouts are now by default sorted by when they were last edited, rather than their name. You can change this on the Loadouts page or in settings. Let us know what you think, and how it can be made more useful!

## 6.91.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-16)</span>

* Put back the full item tile in Compare.

## 6.91.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-16)</span>

* Fix issue in Loadout Optimizer where only one set would show when using Safari or iOS apps.

* The link to D2Gunsmith from the Armory view is now shown on mobile.

## 6.90.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-11-07)</span>

* Fixed an issue where the Loadout Optimizer would allow masterworked items to have their energy changed when using the Ascendant Shard (not exotic) armor upgrade option.
* Fixed an issue where clicking a mod icon in the Loadout Optimizer would select more than one of the mod.

## 6.89.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-31)</span>

## 6.88.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-28)</span>

* `modslot:activity` now identifies Armor 2.0 items that have a modslot related to an activity (currently, a raid or a Nightmare mod slot).
* Fix an issue where an invalid query is passed to the Loadout Optimizer when you click a mod socket.

### Beta Only

* Loadouts can now show you an assignment strategy for mods. It optimizes for the least number of unassigned mods.

## 6.88.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-24)</span>

* DIM will now display Shaders if they were leftover in your Vault after the transmog conversion.
* The item popup has a toggle to choose between list-style perks (easier to read!) and grid-style perks (matches in game). No, we will not add an option to change the order of the list-style perks.
* List-style perks in the item popup have a hover tooltip on desktop so you don't have to click them if you don't want to.
* The item popup has a button to select all the wishlisted perks if they aren't already the active perks, so you can preview the wishlisted version of the item quickly.
* Added a "is:statlower" search that shows armor that has strictly worse stats than another piece of armor of the same type. This does not take into account special mod slots, element, or masterworked-ness. "is:customstatlower" is the same thing but only pays attention to the stats in each class' custom total stat.
* Stat bars now correctly subtract the value of mods from the base segment.

## 6.87.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-17)</span>

* Moved "Tracked Triumphs" section to the top of the Progress page.
* You can now track and untrack Seasonal Challenges from the Progress page.
* Loadout Optimizer now correctly handles nightmare mods.
* Loadout Optimizer makes a better attempt at assigning mods to compared loadouts.
* Added `is:infusionfodder` search to show items where a lower-power version of the same item exists. Use `tag:junk is:infusionfodder` to check your trash for its potential to infuse!
* Loadout Optimizer will warn you if you try to load a build that's for a character class you don't have.
* If your D1 account had disappeared from DIM, it's back now.
* Aeon exotic armor pieces now show mod slots again.
* In Loadout Optimizer, the Select Exotic menu now lets you select "No Exotic" and "Any Exotic". "No Exotic" is the same as searching "not:exotic" before, and "Any Exotic" makes sure each set has an exotic, but doesn't care which one.

## 6.86.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-10)</span>

* Clicking a perk in the item popup now previews the stat changes from switching to that perk.
* Clicking a perk in the Organizer view also previews the stats for that perk.
* Changes to the Armory view (bring up Armory by clicking an item's name in the item popup):
  * Armory highlights which perks cannot roll on new copies of the weapon.
  * Armory highlights the perks rolled on the item you clicked.

  * You can click the "DIM" link to open the item info on its own, and share a roll with others.
  * Clicking modslots lets you change mods.
  * Selecting different ornaments shows what the ornament looks like on the item.
  * Added a link to D2 Gunsmith for weapons.
* Inventory screen can now be sorted by whether an item is masterworked. Check [Settings](/settings) to view and rearrange your sort strategy.
* Loadout Optimizer shows an estimate of how long it'll take to complete finding sets.
* DIM shouldn't bounce you to your D1 account when Bungie.net is having issues anymore.
* `is:maxpower` search now shows all the items at maximum power, instead of just the items that are part of your maximum power loadout. The previous meaning has been moved to `is:maxpowerloadout`. Keep in mind that because of exotics, you may not be able to equip all your max power items at once.

### Beta Only

* Loadout Optimizer now shows the maximum stat tier you can get for each stat, taking into account all of your loadout settings including min/max stats, mods, and search filter. We're still not sure of the best way to display this, so it's in Beta only for now to get some feedback.
* We've tweaked the way Loadout Optimizer chooses which subset of items to look at when you have too many items to process. We should be better at making use of items that have "spiky" stats.

### Beta Only

* Removed the press-and-hold mobile item menu, which saw very limited use. This will also be removed in the release version after some time.

* Armor mods with conditional stats, like Powerful Friends and Radiant Light, now correctly take into account the conditions that cause their stats to be applied. This only works within a single piece of armor - for example, it will work if you have Powerful Friends and another Arc mod is socketed into that piece of armor, but will not yet correctly identify that the stats should be enabled when you have another Arc Charged With Light mod on *another* piece of armor.
* Masterworked Adept weapons should show all their stat bonuses.
* Fix a bug where using the move buttons instead of drag and drop wouldn't show item move progress popups or error popups.

This is partly to make perks easier to understand, but also to allow for more actions on perks in the future. Let us know what you think! Animations will be added later if this design catches on.
* Continued improvements to Active mode, incorporating Bounty Guide and better suggested vendor bounties.

* Bounties and Quests sections on the Progress page now show a summary of bounties by their requirement - weapon, location, activity, and element. Click on a category to see bounties that include that category. Other categories will light up to show "synergy" categories that can be worked on while you work on the selected one. Shift-click to select multiple categories. Click the (+) on a weapon type to pull a weapon matching that type.

* Fixed filter helper only opening the first time it is selected in the search bar
* Pinnacle/powerful rewards show a more accurate bonus, taking into account your current max power.

### Beta Only

* A new "Single character mode" can be enabled through settings, or the « icon on desktop. This focuses down to a single character, and merges your other characters' inventories into the vault (they're really still on the other characters, we're just displaying them different). This is intended for people who are focused on one character, and always shows the last played character when collapsed.

## 6.40.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-22)</span>

* Mod and mod slot info in Loadout Optimizer have been updated to handle the new mod slots better.
* Postmaster items can be dragged over any items on your character to transfer them - they don't need to be dragged to the matching item type.
* Stop showing extra +3 stats on masterwork weapons. The fix for this means that Adept weapons may not show that bonus when they are released.
* Progress page now shows more Milestones/Challenges, shows rewards for all of them, includes vendor pictures where available, and gives a hint as to what power pinnacle/powerful engrams can drop at.

## 6.39.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-16)</span>

* Farming mode will no longer immediately kick out items you manually move onto your character.

* The Raids section is back in Progress, and Garden of Salvation shows up in Milestones.
* Search autocomplete suggests the `current` and `next` keywords for seasons.

* Armor tiles now display the energy capacity of the armor.
* Masterwork levels in the mod details menu once again show which level masterwork they are.
* Added a new sort order for items, sort by Seasonal icon.

* Fixed a visual glitch where the tagging menu looked bad.

## 6.38.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-11)</span>

* Removed character gender from tiles and notifications.
* Don't show empty archetype bar for items in collections.
* Deprecated the `sunsetsafter` search filter because its meaning is unclear. Introduced the `sunsetsin` filter and the `is:sunset` filter.
  * Try out `sunsetsin:hunt` for weapons which reached their power cap in season 11.
  * `is:sunset` won't show anything until Beyond Light launches!
* Added `current` and `next` as season names for searches. Search `sunsetsin:next` to see what'll be capped in next season even before it has an official name.
* Vendorengrams.xyz integration has been removed, because of the vendor changes in Beyond Light.
* Legacy Triumphs have been removed.
* Fixed the Progress page not loading.
* Fixed Catalysts not showing on the Records page.

* Fixed not being able to scroll on mobile.
* Fixed filter help not always showing up.

## 6.37.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-01)</span>

* Removed "Color Blind Mode" setting. This didn't help with DIM's accessibility - it just put a filter over the page to *simulate what it would be like* if you had various forms of color blindness.
* Added `hunt` as valid season synonym.
* Clicking on the energy track or element for armor can now let you preview how much it'd cost in total to upgrade energy or change element.

* Fixed the display of stat trackers for raid speed runs.

* Made the item popup a bit thinner.
* Collapsing sections now animate open and closed.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with a new "Search Results" sheet that shows all the items matching your search in one place.

## 6.35.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-10-18)</span>

* Added the "sidecar" for item popup actions on desktop. This lets us have more actions, and they're easier to understand. If you always use drag and drop, you can collapse the sidecar down into a smaller version.
* On mobile, press and hold on an item to access a quick actions menu, then drag your finger to an option and release to execute it. Move items faster than ever before!
* Added buttons to the settings page to restore the default wish list URL.
* Tweaked the Loadout Optimizer to make it easier to understand, and more clearly highlight that stats can be dragged to reorder them.

* D1 items can no longer incorrectly offer the ability to pull from postmaster.

## 6.34.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-10-11)</span>

* Replaced the tagging dropdown with a nicer one that shows the icon and keyboard shortcut hints.
* Made the farming mode popup on mobile not overlap the category selector, and made it smaller.

* In the Organizer, the selected perk for multi-option perks is now bold.
* Updated the style and tooltip for wishlist perks to match the thumb icon shown on tiles.

* Fixed character stats only displaying the current character's stats on mobile.
* Fixed Postmaster not appearing on D1 for mobile.

## 6.32.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-27)</span>

* In Compare, you can click on perks to see what the new stats would look like if you chose another option.
* When the item popup is open, hitting the "c" key will open Compare.
* Your subclass has been moved below weapons and armor (it's been this way in Beta for a while).
* On mobile, instead of showing all your items at once, there's now a category selection bar that lets you quickly swap between weapons, armor, etc. The postmaster is under "inventory".
* Transferring items is just a touch snappier.
* The tag and compare button on the search bar have been replaced with a dropdown menu (three dots) with a lot more options for things you can do with the items that match your search.

* Fix masterwork tier for some items.
* Fix an issue where searching for "ote" wouldn't suggest "note:"
* The Organizer shows up in the mobile menu, but it just tells you to turn your phone.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with moving the item action buttons to the side of the item popup on desktop - we call it the "sidecar". It moves the actions closer to the mouse, allows room to have clearer labels, and gives more room to add more commands. Plus generally people have screens that are wider than they are tall, so this reduces the height of the popup which could previously put buttons off screen. We'll be tweaking this for a while before it launches fully.
* Beta now has an early preview of a new theme for DIM.

## 6.31.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-22)</span>

* Added a link to the DIM User Guide to the hamburger menu.
* "Clear new items" has been moved into the Settings page instead of being a floating button. The "X" keyboard shortcut no longer clears new items.
* Linear Fusion rifles are technically Fusion Rifles, but they won't show up in Organizer or in searches under Fusion Rifle anymore.
* While API performance is ultimately up to Bungie, we've changed things around in DIM to hopefully make item transfers snappier. Note that these changes mean you may see outdated information in DIM if you've deleted or vaulted items in-game and haven't clicked the refresh button in DIM.
* Improved the autocomplete for `sunsetsafter:` searches.
* Fix the `is:new` search.
* The D1 Activities page now shows Challenge of the Elders completion.

### Beta Only

* On mobile, there is now a bar to quickly swap between different item categories on the inventory screen.

## 6.30.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-13)</span>

* Sword-specific stats now show up in `stat:` filters.

## 6.29.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-11)</span>

* Improved performance of item transfers. We're still limited by how fast Bungie.net's API can go, though.
* Fixed a couple of the legacy triumphs that indicated the wrong triumph was being retired.
* Completed legacy triumph categories, and collections categories, now show the "completed" yellow background.
* is:seasonaldupe now correctly pays attention to the season of the item.
* Fixed a bug where notes wouldn't be saved if you clicked another item before dismissing the item popup.

## 6.29.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-10)</span>

* Triumphs, Collections, and Stat Trackers are now all together in the new Records page.
* You can track triumphs in DIM - tracked triumphs are stored and synced with DIM Sync. These show up on both the Progress and Records pages.
* Everything on the Records page responds to search - search through your Collections, Triumphs, and Stat Trackers all at once!
* Unredeemed triumphs show their rewards
* Compare sheet now offers a Base Stat option for armor, so you can directly compare your stat rolls
* Mod costs now shown in Loadout Optimizer results
* Vendors can now track some "pluggable" items like emotes & ghost projections, to filter by whether you already own them

## 6.27.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-30)</span>

* The new armor 2.0 mod workflow is available in the Loadout Optimizer, this includes:
  * A new Mod Picker component to let you choose armor 2.0 mods to lock.
  * The mod sockets shown in the optimizer are now the locked mods, rather than the mods currently equipped on the item.
  * Clicking on a mod socket will open the picker to show available mods for that slot. Note that locking a mod from this won't guarantee it gets locked to the item specifically.
  * Items have different levels of grouping depending on the requirements of the locked mods. Locking no mods keeps the previous grouping behavior.
  * The mods stat contributions are now shown in the picker.
  * The Mod Picker can now filter for items from a specific season, just filter by the season number directly e.g. "11" for arrivals.
* The search bar now remembers your past searches and allows you to save your favorite searches. These saved and recent searches are synced between devices using DIM Sync.
* The quick item picker (plus icon) menu no longer has an option to equip the selected item. Instead it will always just move the item - very few users selected "Equip" and it won't ever work in game activities.
* Added background colors for items and characters before their images load in, which should reduce the "pop-in" effect.
* Shaders can be tagged from the Collections page and the tags/notes show up there as well.
* Shift+Click on the Notes field in Organizer while in edit mode no longer applies a search.
* For pages with sidebars (like Progress), scrollbars appearing will no longer cover content.

## 6.26.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-23)</span>

* Better touchscreen support for drag and drop.
* Wishlists now support Github gists (raw text URLs), so there's no need to set up an entire repository to host them. If you are making wishlists, you can try out changes easier than ever. If you're not making wishlists, hopefully you're using them. If you don't know what wishlists are, [here you go](https://destinyitemmanager.fandom.com/wiki/Wish_Lists)
* Engrams get a more form-fitting outline on mouse hover.
* If you have a search query active, DIM will not automatically reload to update itself.

* Mobile - changes in DIM beta only: different parts of the header now stick with you as you scroll down.

## 6.24.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-12)</span>

* Updated the character tiles, now uses triple dot instead of chevron
* Solstice of Heroes is back and so is the **Solstice of Heroes** section of the **Progress** tab. Check it out and view your progress toward upgrading armor.

## 6.24.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-09)</span>

* Configure a custom armor stat per-class in Settings, and it'll show up in item popups, Organizer, Compare, and the new `stat:custom:` search.

* `is:smg` for if you're as bad at remembering "submachine gun" as.. some of us are.

* Seasonal Artifact is now previewable, but be warned:
  * Some data from the API is wrong, and the Season 11 artifact is incorrectly labeled.
  * It can show seasonal mods you have equipped, but Season 11 mods still aren't in Collections data, so mod unlocks aren't displayed.
* Spreadsheet columns slightly adjusted to get them back to their usual column names.
* Lots going on behind the scenes to clear up errors and get Loadout Optimizer ready for upgrades!

## 6.23.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-02)</span>

* You can add tags and notes to shaders! Keep track of your favorites and which shaders you could do without.
* Searches now support parentheses for grouping, the "and" keyword, and the "not" keyword. Example: `(is:weapon and is:sniperrifle) or not (is:armor and modslot:arrival)`. "and" has higher precedence than "or", which has higher precedence than just a space (which still means "and").
* Fixed the size of damage type icons in D1.
* Our Content Security Policy is more restrictive now, external and injected scripts may fail but this keeps your account and data safer.

## 6.22.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-07-27)</span>

* Fix a crash with the Twitch gift sub shader.

## 6.17.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-28)</span>

## 6.15.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-15)</span>

## 6.15.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-14)</span>

## 6.13.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-05-31)</span>

* CSV export will no longer erroneously consider calus as a source and instead output the correct source.
