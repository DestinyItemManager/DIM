## Next

* DIM now loads a saved copy of your inventory even when it is offline or Bungie.net is down. The saved copy is whatever information Bungie.net last successfully provided on that device.
  * The refresh button now has a tooltip showing how recently DIM was able to load your inventory from Bungie.net. This can help identify when DIM's view is out of date, relative to the in-game state.
* If DIM Sync is down, the Export Backup button will save a copy of your local data instead of just failing.
* DIM can now automatically sync an item's log state to its tag - favorite, keep, and archive tags auto lock the item, and junk or infuse tags unlock the item. This option needs to be enabled in settings, and when it's on the item tile will no longer show the lock icon for tagged items.
* Loadouts can be filtered with buttons that appear on the list of loadouts. These buttons are populated by any hashtags you use in the loadout name or notes.
* Crafted items will no longer lose their tags/notes or be missing from loadouts after being reshaped. This only affects items that are newly tagged or added to loadouts - crafted weapons that were already tagged or in loadouts will not be preserved when reshaping them.
* Worked around an issue where class item mods from the fourth artifact column would be missing for some players.

### Beta Only

* If you add hashtags to your loadouts' names or notes, DIM will show buttons for quickly filtering down to loadouts that include that hashtag.

  * This should make it easier to open shared loadouts where you're using DIM instead of opening those loadouts in a new browser tab every time.
* Added a "Clear Feed" button to the Item Feed.

* If the DIM API is not returning some info (e.g. searches), we'll fall back to your locally cached data instead of wiping it out.

Please note that the plugin is neither written by nor supported by the DIM team.

## 7.25.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-07-10)</span>

## 7.24.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-07-03)</span>

These can be disabled in settings.

* Fixed a crash when trying to assign deprecated Combat Style mods.

### Beta Only

If you have a Stream Deck you can install this plugin and then enable the connection from DIM's settings to control DIM from your Stream Deck. Please note that the plugin is neither written by nor supported by the DIM team. **If you had installed the old Stream Deck Chrome extension, you need to uninstall it, or DIM will act weird (popups closing, etc).**

* The links on the top of the page will now show for narrower screens. All links are always available in the menu.
* Improved performance of switching characters and opening item picker or search results on iOS. Something had gotten slower with Safari in one of the recent iOS updates, so we had to do a lot of work to get back to a responsive UI.
* Fixed the tooltip in the mod assignment page not showing the correct energy usage.

## 7.22.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-06-19)</span>

* Loadout Optimizer will now suggest class items with an elemental affinity matching the mods even when allowing changes to elemental affinity.
* Fixed an issue where the item popup could appear partly offscreen.
* Items sorted by tag will re-sort themselves immediately after their tag changes.
* DIM now loads full inventory information on load and doesn't require an inventory refresh for certain info including crafting status.

### Beta Only

* Weapon perks now include community-sourced weapon and armor perk descriptions courtesy of [Clarity](https://d2clarity.page.link/websiteDIM) and [Pip1n's Destiny Data Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaxvbLx7UoSZaBqdFr1u32F2uWVLo-CJunJB4nlGUE4/htmlview?pru=AAABe9E7ngw*TxEsfbPsk5ukmr0FbZfK8w#).

## 7.20.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-06-05)</span>

* Little clearer warning when you have hidden a major section of your inventory.
* Moved the currencies (glimmer, legendary shards, etc) from the "Armor" tab to the "Inventory" tab on mobile, and also included them in the material counts sheet (accessible from Vault header dropdown).

## 7.19.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-29)</span>

* Enhanced intrinsics on crafted weapons are now treated as a masterwork internally. As a result, you can use e.g. `is:crafted -masterwork:any` to find crafted weapons without an enhanced intrinsic. The golden border additionally requires two enhanced traits, just like in-game.
* Resonant Element search filters such as `deepsight:ruinous` have been removed as these currencies are now deprecated.
* Selected Super ability is now displayed on Solar subclass icons.
* Features around managing crafting patterns:
  * Items that have a pattern to unlock will show the progress to that pattern in the item popup - even on items that do not have deepsight resonance.
  * Items that can be attuned to make progress in unlocking a pattern have a little triangle on the bottom right of their tile to set them apart.
  * Search filter `deepsight:pattern` finds those items.
  * The search `is:patternunlocked` finds items where the pattern for that item has already been unlocked (whether or not that item is crafted).
  * Don't forget that `is:craftable` highlights any items that can be crafted.
* Fixed Triage tab's similar items search for slug Shotguns.

## 7.18.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-24)</span>

* Loadouts with a Solar subclass will automatically be upgraded to Solar 3.0.
* Show Airborne Effectiveness stat on weapons.

## 7.18.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-22)</span>

* In Loadout Optimizer, the option to lock Masterworked armor to its current element has been replaced with an option to lock the element on armor equipped in other DIM Loadouts.
  * The Witch Queen had reduced the cost of changing the element on a fully masterworked armor piece to 10,000-20,000 Glimmer and one Upgrade Module, making it cheaper than changing the element on a not fully masterworked armor piece.
  * Selecting this option means Loadout Optimizer will suggest changes to armor elements as needed but avoid breaking other Loadouts where mod assignments rely on particular elements.
  * Clicking the "Optimize Armor" button in a Loadout to open Loadout Optimizer excludes this Loadout from consideration because you're actually looking to make changes to this Loadout.
* Loadouts list opened from Vault emblem now won't erroneously warn that Loadouts with subclasses or emblems are missing items.

## 7.17.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-15)</span>

* Popups and tooltips are a bit snappier.
* The close button in the Armory view (click an item's title) no longer overlaps the scrollbar.
* Inventory size stat no longer shows on any item - it used to show on Bows only.

## 7.16.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-09)</span>

* Fix "lower is better" stats not being masterworked gold in the item popup.

## 7.16.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-08)</span>

* Make sure DIM displays the scoring thresholds on the Shoot To Score quest.
* The recoil direction stat has been tweaked to show a much wider spread as the recoil stat value decreases.

## 7.15.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-01)</span>

## 7.14.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-26)</span>

* Reverted Deepsight workaround, so weapon attunement displays correctly.

### Beta Only

* Enabled the Triage tab of the item popup. Find some information here to help decide if an item is worth keeping. Let us know what helps and what could help more!

## 7.14.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-24)</span>

* Work around an issue where Bungie.net is not highlighting completed Deepsight weapons.

## 7.13.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-17)</span>

* If an armor piece doesn't have enough mod slots to fit the requested mods (e.g. three resist mods but no artifice chest piece), DIM will notice this earlier and show them as unassigned in the Show Mod Placement menu.
* Added text labels to "icon-only" columns (lock icon, power icon, etc.) in dropdowns on the Organizer page. Only show label in dropdowns, columns show icon only.
* Echo of Persistence Void Fragment now indicates that it has a stat penalty depending on the Guardian class.
* We no longer auto-refresh inventory if you "overfill" a bucket, as refreshing too quickly was returning out-of-date info from Bungie.net and making items appear to "revert" to an earlier location. Make sure to refresh manually if DIM is getting out of sync with the game state.
* Using the Mod Picker to edit loadout mods should now correctly show all picked mods.
* Selecting a different weapon masterwork tier for previewing should now correctly preview the final value of the changed stat in the masterwork picker.
* Fixed a case where the "Gift of the Lighthouse" item might be in your inventory but not show up in DIM. Allowed some items with missing names to appear in your inventory.

## 7.12.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-10)</span>

* If a wish list contains only non-enhanced perks, DIM will mark a roll as matching if it has the Enhanced versions of those perks.
* Fixed a rare edge case where Loadout Optimizer would not consider legendary armor if you own an exotic with strictly better stats.
* Glaive symbol now shows up in bounties, challenges, etc.
* `is:extraperk` filter finds weapons with additional toggleable perks, from pinnacle activities and Umbral Focusing.
* Fixed perk grouping for some perk-only wish lists.
* Armory wish list view now shows perks, magazines, barrels, etc. in a similar order to the in-game view.
* Re-added the D2Gunsmith link to the weapons armory page.
* `memento:any`, `memento:nightfall` etc. filters find crafted weapons with a memento inserted.

* The Item Popup's header now opens the Armory view when clicked, and has some cursor/link styling as a reminder.
* Deprecated Black Armory Radiance slots are now hidden, to make space for other weapon data.

* Enhanced Elemental Capacitor no longer adds all its stat bonuses to weapons on which it's selected.
* Fynch rank is now showing the correct number on the Vendors page.
* Fixed loadouts with Void 3.0 subclasses accidentally including empty fragment or aspect sockets.
* Fixed loadouts failing to remove mods from some armor or inadvertently changing the Aeon sect mod.
* Invalid search terms no longer cause the entire search to match every item.
* Searches do better with quoted strings, and allow for escaping quotes in strings (e.g. `"My \"Cool\" Loadout"`)
* Item moves are better about allowing a move if you really have space on a character, even if DIM hasn't refreshed its view of inventory. That said, DIM will always work best when its view of your inventory is up to date, so continue to refresh data after deleting items in game. DIM will now refresh automatically if we "overfill" a bucket because clearly we're out of date in that circumstance.
* Mod Picker will now properly register Shadowkeep Nightmare Mods as activity mods.
* Selected Super ability is now displayed on Void and Stasis subclass icons.
* Mod position selector avoids invalid sockets a little better.

## 7.10.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-27)</span>

* Dragging horizontally on items in Compare will scroll the list - even on iOS.
* Mobile users can now access Material Counts under the banner dropdown of the Vault inventory page.
* In the Armory and Collection views, craftable weapons now show their required Weapon Level in their tooltip.
* DIM should no longer get visually mangled by Android's auto-dark-mode.
* Fixed an incorrect item count in non-English inventory searches.
* Try a little harder to re-fetch item definitions data, if Bungie.net sends back an invalid response.
* Searches that can't be saved (because they're too long, or invalid) won't show a save ⭐️ button.
* Search filters can contain comments. Only the top level comment gets saved. e.g. `/* My Cool Search */ is:handcannon perkname:firefly`.
* Loadouts
  * The loadout search field has been moved to the top of the loadout menu, which should prevent iOS from going crazy. Filtering loadouts hides the other buttons as well.
  * Sharing a loadout now shows an explanation of what's being shared.
  * Fixed the loadout drawer not opening when "+ Create Loadout" is selected from the vault.
  * Fixed "Fill from Equipped" going a little overboard on what it tried to add to the loadout, and spamming notifications.

## 7.9.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-20)</span>

* The Progress page properly distinguishes between +1 and +2 pinnacles.

## 7.8.3 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-15)</span>

* Fixed loadout search filter to include notes

## 7.8.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-14)</span>

* Assume armor masterwork and lock armor energy options will now be saved correctly when saving a loadout from the Loadout Optimizer and loaded correctly when Optimizing Armor.
* Obsolete consumable mods hidden in the Vault are now detected. They should show up on the Inventory page, and DIM should count vault space more accurately.
* Prevent iOS from popping up the keyboard automatically so often.
* Prevent crafting socket from showing up in the Armory.
* Clearer, prettier Enhanced Perk icons.
* Raid crafting materials are now included in the currency counter. Tap and hold, or hover, the consumables count in the vault header to check them.
* Many fixes for how classified items show up, and how they count toward the power level of each Guardian class. Can't see these fixes now, but maybe next time there's a new Raid.
* New search support for `source:vow` (Vow of the Disciple) and `source:grasp` (Grasp of Avarice) and `season:16`.

## 7.8.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-06)</span>

### Changes

* The "Pull From Postmaster" button no longer requires a second tap to confirm. For those who dislike this button, it may be removed entirely via a setting in the Settings page.
* Removed D2Gunsmith link from the item details popup while they work on revamping the site for all the new changes.
* Removed the `level:` filter for D2 accounts, as Guardians no longer have a Level and items no longer require one.
* Season of the Risen War Table Upgrades are now in the right order and show their acquired status.
* Loadout Optimizer Mod picker will now correctly update when switching between mod slots without closing Mod Picker.
* Loadout Optimizer now correctly takes Echo of Persistence's class-specific stat reductions into account when generating sets.
* The "Kinetic Slot" icon in Compare sheet now looks different from the "Kinetic Damage" icon.

### Features

* `is:wishlistunknown` highlights items that have no rolls in the currently loaded wishlist.
* When you have 10 or more loadouts, a search box will appear in the Inventory page loadout dropdown, allowing you to search names just like on the Loadouts page.
* The Item Feed is available on both desktop and mobile. It shows your gear in the order it dropped, and gives you quick controls to tag incoming loot. Click on the item tile to get the full item popup.
  * Item Feed also got better at identifying relevant weapon perks.
  * Tagging an item from the Item Feed also marks it as not-new.
  * Items can be dragged out of the feed into inventory locations (or into the loadout editor).
* We have brand new Loadout Editor! Check it out from the character menu or the Loadouts page.
  * The layout mirrors the Loadout page's new design which has clear areas for different types of items. Each section also has a menu of additional actions like re-syncing from your currently equipped items, or clearing out a whole section.
  * As part of this change, we're removing support for "multi-class" loadouts. Loadouts will either be tied to one class, or can be toggled to "Any Class". "Any Class" loadouts cannot contain Subclass, Armor, or Fashion. If you edit an existing "Any Class" loadout and save it, those items will be removed unless you turn off "Any Class".
  * Double-click items to toggle between equipped and unequipped instead of single clicking. We'll be continuing to improve how you choose items and specify whether they're equipped in the future.
  * A new setting allows you to clear out all other mods from your armor when applying a loadout. This works even if you've chosen no mods in your loadout, so you can make a "Reset mods" loadout.
  * With this new design we have space to add even more loadout editing tools over the next few seasons.
  * The loadout editor stays open if you navigate to the Inventory or Loadouts screen while it's already open.
  * The new Loadout Editor is not available for D1.
