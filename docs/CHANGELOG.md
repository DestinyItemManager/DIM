* Added `source:sundereddoctrine` for the new dungeon.
* Updated the color scale used for stats in Compare - there is now greater separation between the worst (red) and the best (green, with blue for the best stat).

## 8.59.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2025-02-16)</span>

* Added Pathfinder reward info.

## 8.59.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2025-02-16)</span>

## 8.57.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2025-02-03)</span>

* DIM Sync data is now loaded incrementally, instead of being completely refreshed every time. This should result in faster updates, but otherwise nothing should be different. If you notice things are out of sync, you can click the "Reload remote data from DIM sync" button in Settings, but please let us know if you needed to do that.

## 8.57.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2025-02-02)</span>

* DIM now coordinates in a limited way between different tabs/windows. Only one tab will load data at a time, and when it does, all other tabs will refresh immediately. Item moves are also reflected immediately across tabs. This should help prevent tabs from getting out of sync with each other.

* Removed the 15 second timer on being able to check for new data from Bungie.net.

* The text in the search history page is selectable.

* Added `is:enhancementready` search that finds weapons which have reached level thresholds to enhance perks

  * For enhanced weapons, this looks at whether the next tier of enhancement is selectable on the weapon
* Updated `enhancedperk` search to allow `is:enhancedperk` to find any weapons with already-enhanced perk columns

## 8.51.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-12-15)</span>

* Added a wishlist refresh button in Settings to help with wishlist development. Note that GitHub can take upwards of 10min to actually reflect your changes. Refreshing won't speed up GitHub.

## 8.38.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-09-22)</span>

* Renamed `is:class` to `is:subclass`.
* Fixed D1 item category searches such as `is:primary` and `is:horn`. Now they're up to parity with the D2 categories.

## 8.36.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-09-08)</span>

* In the item picker, you can long-press or shift-click an item to see its item details. A regular click still pulls that item.

* Add Enhancement tier to weapon level bar.

## 8.30.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-07-28)</span>

* Remove damage mods and empty memento sockets from item popups.
* A bunch of changes to Vault Organizer:
  * Sorting now uses a local-sensitive comparator by default.
  * You can sort perk columns - they sort by the name of the first perk, and then the name of the second perk, and so on. This should help with exotic class items.
  * Broke out armor intrinsics, cosmetics (shaders/ornaments), and weapon origin traits into their own columns.
  * Now that everything has its own column, the plain "perks" column is now restricted to perks/mods that don't appear in other columns.

* In the item feed, perks in the same column now have a bar on the left to indicate they are together.

* Add `light:` filter to the Loadouts search. Only works with loadouts that equip an item for all weapon and armor slots.
* DIM now calculates Account Power level, which uses all items from all characters, and determines their "current power level" for the purposes of new item drops.
  * This number can be found in the header for Vault
  * Details can be found by clicking any character's gear Power level, below their header/dropdown.
* Cleaned up armor upgrade slots and inactive Artifice slots showing up in the Item Popup.

## 8.21.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-05-26)</span>

## 8.19.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-05-15)</span>

## 8.19.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-05-12)</span>

* Loadouts now have their own search language that you can use from the Loadouts page or character emblem dropdown. This works the same as item search, but the search keywords are different and loadout-specific. We'll add more search keywords over time.
* When you change language, DIM immediately loads the item database for that language - you no longer need to reload.
* DIM now loads new item database after content updates without requiring a reload, as long as there's an item in your inventory from that new content.
* Fixed the icon for "Material Counts" in the vault dropdown on mobile.
* Removed some useless search suggestions like `exactname:gauntlets`.
* Fixed some crashes when Google Translate is enabled. Please don't use Google Translate on DIM though, use our language settings.
* Added a grace period before DIM stops auto-refreshing because you're not playing. This should prevent DIM from giving up on auto refresh when you change characters.
* Added some new protections against losing tags when Bungie.net is misbehaving, though it still may not be able to handle some weirdness.
* Fixed the filter help not showing up in some circumstances.

## 8.19.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-05-05)</span>

## 8.3.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-01-14)</span>

* Loadout Optimizer once again allows you to set a maximum stat tier, by Shift-clicking on a stat number (this is the only way to do it, for now). Unlike the previous stat max setting, this does not exclude builds that meet all your other requirements but need to put points in a maxed stat, resulting in more optimal builds overall.
* Show more information about quest lines, even if steps are classified.

## 8.2.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2024-01-07)</span>

* Support the newest version of the DIM StreamDeck plugin.

## 8.1.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-12-31)</span>

* In the mod picker, we now show just "Stackable" or "Unstackable" instead of the full requirements for the mod (like its exact stackability or what raid it belongs to).

* Individual wish lists can be toggled on and off and the Just Another Team wishlist is available as a suggested option.
* Catalysts can be searched for on the Records page using search terms that would match their associated item.
* Clicking a catalyst on the Records page shows the item popup for its associated collections item.
* Loadout Optimizer's "Pin Items" and "Excluded Items" sections have been slightly redesigned, and now both have clear-all buttons.

## 7.98.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-12-10)</span>

* Fixed a bug where in-game loadouts would be marked as matching a DIM loadout incorrectly.

## 7.94.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-11-13)</span>

* Fixed an edge case where Loadout Optimizer's "Strict Upgrades Only" mode from clicking Optimize Armor on the Loadouts page could result in too few sets.

## 7.94.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-11-12)</span>

* There is now an option in settings to group items in your vault by Item Type, Rarity, Ammo Type, Tag, or Damage Type.
* On the Loadouts page, DIM now runs the Loadout Optimizer in the background to find out which of your loadouts could have better stats by swapping armor.
* Loadout optimizer has a new stat tier editor which allows you to set your minimum stat tiers more intuitively. It is no longer possible to explicitly set maximum stat tiers - make sure you've added your subclass and mod configuration, set stat order, and ignore stats you don't want DIM to optimize, and you'll get the best possible sets.
* In the loadout editor, replacing a missing item works even if you have 10 items in that slot.
* Links in notes can no longer result in spurious hashtags.
* Moving items from a search can once again move consumables/materials.

## 7.93.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-11-05)</span>

* The Loadouts page will now analyze your Loadouts in more depth, show filter pills for analysis findings, and note them in individual Loadouts too.
  * Examples are Loadouts where the mods don't fit on the armor, Loadouts that rely on seasonal mods, or Loadouts where armor needs to be upgraded to accommodate mods or reach target stats.
* Loadout optimizer will now use an effective energy of 9 for items that it is not assuming masterworked stats for. Before, it used an effective energy of 7, but enhancement prisms are easier to come by these days.

* Fixed accidentally showing the kill tracker perk column on the item popup.

* Removed link to Destiny Tracker from the Armory page.

* Fix tooltips getting stuck open if you scroll in Compare while they're shown.
* The mod selection menu now shows you how many of each type of mod you've chosen, and what the limit is.

## 7.84.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-09-06)</span>

* Fixed the character menu scrolling the page to the top.

## 7.82.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-08-20)</span>

* Again fixed unsaving previously saved, now invalid search queries.

* Added vendor engrams to the materials tooltip/sheet accessible through or near the vault emblem.
* The "Search History" table can now be sorted by its columns (times used, last used) just like the Organizer.

## 7.80.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-08-06)</span>

## 7.77.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-07-17)</span>

This means Special Grenade Launchers now have their own Organizer tab, Triage for Heavy Grenade Launchers will no longer show "similar" Special Grenade Launchers, and Compare will not include them when comparing Heavy Grenade Launchers.
* When opening the Compare view from the Triage tab of a Vendor item, this Vendor item will now be included in the compared items.
* New versions of the Last Wish weapons now appear in collections.
* Added Bungie Day Giving Festival Banner.

## 7.72.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-06-11)</span>

* Fixed showing the item under your finger while you're dragging it on iOS/iPadOS. As a reminder, on touchscreen devices you need to press the item for a little bit to "pick it up". And as a reminder for everyone, any time you see an item in DIM, pretty much wherever it is, you can drag it around to move the item or add it to a Loadout you're editing. This works from the Inventory, Item Feed, Loadouts screen, etc.
* The Loadouts page now has a filter pill to find Loadouts with empty Fragment sockets.
* The popup shown on the refresh button when Bungie.net is down no longer has buttons you can't click, and no longer exceeds the width of the screen on mobile.

## 7.71.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-06-04)</span>

* Added Community Insights for the impact of various stat tiers on ability cooldowns, etc. This takes into account your current subclass config and equipped exotic. For loadouts, it uses the subclass config and exotic that are saved in the loadout to display details. This information comes from the Clarity database, and like all Community Insights is sourced from lots of manual investigation.
* Automatic stat mods in Loadout Optimizer have graduated from Beta! We now remember this setting, and we ignore any manually chosen stat mods when auto stat mods are on. Enabling auto stat mods allows Loadout Optimizer to automatically assign stat mods to potential loadouts in order to hit the stats you've requested, in the priority order that you've chosen.
* Fixed an issue where DIM might not properly force you to re-login with Bungie.net, and would instead continually throw errors trying to talk to Bungie.net.

* Added `is:iningameloadout` search to find items that are in an in-game loadout.

* Fixed the sizing and spacing of abilities in the subclass picker.

* Updated information used to detect which season an item is from, after changes in the Bungie.net data since Season of the Deep.
* Improved the hover indication for the search field buttons.
* Fixed tracking crafted date for loadouts - they were not saving crafted date for items as intended, and were thus losing crafted items when they got reshaped.

## 7.69.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-05-21)</span>

## 7.68.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-05-14)</span>

## 7.66.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-30)</span>

## 7.65.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-28)</span>

* Enhanced adept weapons from Root of Nightmares should now show with correct stats.

## 7.65.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-23)</span>

* Fixed Adept Draw Time marking the draw time stat as negatively affected (red) instead of positively affected (blue).
* Loadout Optimizer and Loadouts now consistently allow you to choose not yet unlocked Fragments and Aspects. Previously this was only working for some characters.

## 7.64.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-16)</span>

* In-Game Loadouts are now represented as save slots. Click them for details on which items and selections they contain.

  * The overview In-Game Loadouts strip now shows whether each slot matches a DIM loadout, is equipped, or is equippable.

* Fixed issue where selected mods would not scroll on mobile in the mod sheet.
* Items can now be dragged and dropped from within the loadout edit screen.
* Loadout Optimizer and Loadouts now include Armor Charge-based "Font of ..." mods in stat calculations. For example, if you are using the Font of Focus armor mod, Loadout Optimizer will assume the +30 points to Discipline when holding Armor Charge are active and not waste stat points on exceeding T10 Discipline.

## 7.64.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-09)</span>

* Updated DIM's Smart Moves logic for how to choose which items to move when a bucket is full.
* The bulk note tool has gotten a major upgrade and now allows adding and removing to existing notes.
* Undo and redo in loadout editor and loadout optimizer have the keyboard shortcuts you'd expect.

## 7.63.3 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-04-06)</span>

* Fixed equipping in game loadouts

* Mods in the loadout mods picker are now more logically ordered by matching the in-game order.

* Fixed the `modslot:any`/`modslot:none` filters.
* Fixed an issue where some subclass fragments and armor mods would be missing descriptions in Loadout Optimizer and the Loadout editor.
* The minor boosts to all stats that enhanced crafted and masterworked adept weapons have are now ignored in Organizer's "Masterwork Stat" column and by the `masterwork:statname` filter. Only the primary +10 boost is considered.
* Sharing build settings directly from Loadout Optimizer will now also include subclass configuration.
* DIM now saves Artifact configuration in Loadouts. Note that DIM cannot reconfigure your artifact automatically, but you can use this information to keep track of which artifact unlocks are important for a Loadout.
* Search autocomplete should be smarter, with the ability to complete item and perk names even when you type multiple words.
* In-game loadouts' icon, color, and name can now be changed through DIM.

* Clicking "Manage Loadouts" from the character menu will bring you to the Loadouts screen for that character instead of your active character.

* Fixed powerful and pinnacle reward calculations.

## 7.59.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-03-05)</span>

## 7.58.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-03-02)</span>

* DIM supports displaying and equipping in-game loadouts.
* Triage tab is now available outside of DIM Beta. This feature provides information to help quickly compare and judge a new (or old) item.

* Fixed the Compare tool for items with quotation marks in their name.

* Loadout hashtags are now auto-completed in the Loadout name and notes fields. Type `#` to suggest tags used in other Loadouts.
* Destiny symbols are now available in Loadout names and notes, and item notes. Type `:` for symbol suggestions or use the symbols picker in the text fields.
* The "Sync item lock state with tag" setting now excludes crafted weapons, as DIM would otherwise re-lock crafted weapons during reshaping.

## 7.51.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-01-08)</span>

## 7.50.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2023-01-01)</span>

* DIM now loads a saved copy of your inventory even when it is offline or Bungie.net is down. The saved copy is whatever information Bungie.net last successfully provided on that device.
  * The refresh button now has a tooltip showing how recently DIM was able to load your inventory from Bungie.net. This can help identify when DIM's view is out of date, relative to the in-game state.
* If DIM Sync is down, the Export Backup button will save a copy of your local data instead of just failing.
* DIM can now automatically sync an item's log state to its tag - favorite, keep, and archive tags auto lock the item, and junk or infuse tags unlock the item. This option needs to be enabled in settings, and when it's on the item tile will no longer show the lock icon for tagged items.
* Crafted items will no longer lose their tags/notes or be missing from loadouts after being reshaped. This only affects items that are newly tagged or added to loadouts - crafted weapons that were already tagged or in loadouts will not be preserved when reshaping them.
* Worked around an issue where class item mods from the fourth artifact column would be missing for some players.

### Beta Only

* If you add hashtags to your loadouts' names or notes, DIM will show buttons for quickly filtering down to loadouts that include that hashtag.

* Using the "Import Loadout" button on the Loadouts page, you can now paste loadout share links (like `dim.gg` links or links generated by other community sites) to open these loadouts directly in DIM.
  * This should make it easier to open shared loadouts where you're using DIM instead of opening those loadouts in a new browser tab every time.
* Added a "Clear Feed" button to the Item Feed.

## 7.47.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-12-11)</span>

* Fixed Compare drawer closing when clicking the button to compare all of a certain weapon type.

## 7.41.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-10-30)</span>

## 7.32.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-08-28)</span>

* If the DIM API is down and you have pending updates, DIM will load correctly instead of spinning forever. We also do a better job of keeping changes you make while the API is down.
* If the DIM API is not returning some info (e.g. searches), we'll fall back to your locally cached data instead of wiping it out.
* Updating/overwriting a Loadout using Loadout Optimizer's "Compare Loadout" button will now correctly remove the placeholders for armor equipped in the Loadout that no longer exists.
* The item sort for Weapon Damage Type and Armor Element Type are now separate.
* Epic Games accounts should display properly in the menu.
* The loadout name editor will no longer offer system autocomplete.

* When prioritizing where to place other Arc armor mods, DIM Loadout Mod assignment will now try to activate the secondary perks of all types of Arc Charged With Light mods.
* Fixed the "Remove other mods" toggle in Loadouts resetting when saving the Loadout as "Any Class".
* Fixed missing element icons in the Triage pane.
* Added a "Strip Sockets" search action to remove shaders, ornaments, weapon, armor, and artifact mods. This is available from the advanced actions dropdown to the right of the search field. Search for targeted items first, then choose what to remove.
* Eliminated an unnecessary 10 second pause when loading DIM if the DIM Sync service is down.
* Fixed search filter string disappearing when rotating or majorly resizing the DIM window.

If you have a Stream Deck you can install this plugin and then enable the connection from DIM's settings to control DIM from your Stream Deck. Please note that the plugin is neither written by nor supported by the DIM team.

## 7.25.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-07-10)</span>

## 7.24.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-07-03)</span>

* Weapon perks now include community-sourced weapon and armor perk descriptions courtesy of [Clarity](https://d2clarity.page.link/websiteDIM) and [Pip1n's Destiny Data Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaxvbLx7UoSZaBqdFr1u32F2uWVLo-CJunJB4nlGUE4/htmlview?pru=AAABe9E7ngw*TxEsfbPsk5ukmr0FbZfK8w#). These can be disabled in settings.

* If you have a title equipped on your character, it will replace your character's race in the character headers.
* Fixed a crash when trying to assign deprecated Combat Style mods.

* Added filter for enhanced perks.

### Beta Only

If you have a Stream Deck you can install this plugin and then enable the connection from DIM's settings to control DIM from your Stream Deck. Please note that the plugin is neither written by nor supported by the DIM team. **If you had installed the old Stream Deck Chrome extension, you need to uninstall it, or DIM will act weird (popups closing, etc).**

* Fix missing icons in the subclass and mod menus.

* The links on the top of the page will now show for narrower screens. All links are always available in the menu.
* Improved performance of switching characters and opening item picker or search results on iOS. Something had gotten slower with Safari in one of the recent iOS updates, so we had to do a lot of work to get back to a responsive UI.
* Fixed the tooltip in the mod assignment page not showing the correct energy usage.

## 7.22.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-06-19)</span>

* Fixed a rare edge case where Loadout Optimizer would miss certain valid elemental mod assignments with locked armor energy types.
* When moving multiple items, DIM will transfer them in a more consistent order e.g. Kinetic weapons are moved before Heavy weapons, helmets before chest armor etc.
* Fixed Organizer redundantly showing enhanced weapon intrinsics in multiple columns.
* Vendor items once again show wish list thumbsup icons.

* The [DIM User Guide](https://guide.dim.gg) has moved back to GitHub from Fandom, so you can read about DIM without intrusive ads.
* When making automatic moves, DIM will always avoid filling in your last open Consumables slot. An item can still be manually moved into your character's pockets as the 50th consumable.
* Loadout Optimizer will now suggest class items with an elemental affinity matching the mods even when allowing changes to elemental affinity.
* Fixed an issue where the item popup could appear partly offscreen.
* Items sorted by tag will re-sort themselves immediately after their tag changes.
* DIM now loads full inventory information on load and doesn't require an inventory refresh for certain info including crafting status.

### Beta Only

* Weapon perks now include community-sourced weapon and armor perk descriptions courtesy of [Clarity](https://d2clarity.page.link/websiteDIM) and [Pip1n's Destiny Data Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaxvbLx7UoSZaBqdFr1u32F2uWVLo-CJunJB4nlGUE4/htmlview?pru=AAABe9E7ngw*TxEsfbPsk5ukmr0FbZfK8w#). These can be disabled in settings.

## 7.20.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-06-06)</span>

* Fixed some items showing the wrong popup.

## 7.20.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-06-05)</span>

* The top level comment of a saved search filter is now displayed separately from the filter query.
* Support for new loot: `source:duality` and `source:haunted`.
* Little clearer warning when you have hidden a major section of your inventory.
* Moved the currencies (glimmer, legendary shards, etc) from the "Armor" tab to the "Inventory" tab on mobile, and also included them in the material counts sheet (accessible from Vault header dropdown).

## 7.19.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-29)</span>

* Enhanced intrinsics on crafted weapons are now treated as a masterwork internally. As a result, you can use e.g. `is:crafted -masterwork:any` to find crafted weapons without an enhanced intrinsic. The golden border additionally requires two enhanced traits, just like in-game.
* Resonant Element search filters such as `deepsight:ruinous` have been removed as these currencies are now deprecated.
* Selected Super ability is now displayed on Solar subclass icons.
* Features around managing crafting patterns:
  * Items that have a pattern to unlock will show the progress to that pattern in the item popup - even on items that do not have deepsight resonance.
  * Items that can be attuned to make progress in unlocking a pattern have a little triangle on the bottom right of their tile to set them apart.
  * Search filter `deepsight:pattern` finds those items.
  * The search `is:patternunlocked` finds items where the pattern for that item has already been unlocked (whether or not that item is crafted).
  * Don't forget that `is:craftable` highlights any items that can be crafted.
* Fixed Triage tab's similar items search for slug Shotguns.

## 7.18.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-24)</span>

* Added seasonal info for Season of the Haunted and fixed some bugs with new items.
* Loadouts with a Solar subclass will automatically be upgraded to Solar 3.0.
* Show Airborne Effectiveness stat on weapons.

## 7.18.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-22)</span>

* In Loadout Optimizer, the option to lock Masterworked armor to its current element has been replaced with an option to lock the element on armor equipped in other DIM Loadouts.
  * The Witch Queen had reduced the cost of changing the element on a fully masterworked armor piece to 10,000-20,000 Glimmer and one Upgrade Module, making it cheaper than changing the element on a not fully masterworked armor piece.
  * Selecting this option means Loadout Optimizer will suggest changes to armor elements as needed but avoid breaking other Loadouts where mod assignments rely on particular elements.
  * Clicking the "Optimize Armor" button in a Loadout to open Loadout Optimizer excludes this Loadout from consideration because you're actually looking to make changes to this Loadout.
* Loadouts list opened from Vault emblem now won't erroneously warn that Loadouts with subclasses or emblems are missing items.

## 7.17.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-15)</span>

* Fixed a glitch in Loadout Optimizer where legendary armor intrinsic perks could be clicked to lock that piece as an exotic.
* Fixed double zeroes on armor in Compare.
* Fixed bad stat coloring in Compare when stats are more than 100 points apart (this only really affected power level).
* Popups and tooltips are a bit snappier.
* The close button in the Armory view (click an item's title) no longer overlaps the scrollbar.
* Inventory size stat no longer shows on any item - it used to show on Bows only.

## 7.16.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-09)</span>

* Fix "lower is better" stats not being masterworked gold in the item popup.

## 7.16.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-08)</span>

* Make sure DIM displays the scoring thresholds on the Shoot To Score quest.
* The recoil direction stat has been tweaked to show a much wider spread as the recoil stat value decreases.

## 7.15.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-05-01)</span>

## 7.14.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-26)</span>

* Reverted Deepsight workaround, so weapon attunement displays correctly.

### Beta Only

* Enabled the Triage tab of the item popup. Find some information here to help decide if an item is worth keeping. Let us know what helps and what could help more!

## 7.14.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-24)</span>

* Work around an issue where Bungie.net is not highlighting completed Deepsight weapons.

## 7.13.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-17)</span>

* If an armor piece doesn't have enough mod slots to fit the requested mods (e.g. three resist mods but no artifice chest piece), DIM will notice this earlier and show them as unassigned in the Show Mod Placement menu.
* Added text labels to "icon-only" columns (lock icon, power icon, etc.) in dropdowns on the Organizer page. Only show label in dropdowns, columns show icon only.
* Echo of Persistence Void Fragment now indicates that it has a stat penalty depending on the Guardian class.
* We no longer auto-refresh inventory if you "overfill" a bucket, as refreshing too quickly was returning out-of-date info from Bungie.net and making items appear to "revert" to an earlier location. Make sure to refresh manually if DIM is getting out of sync with the game state.
* Using the Mod Picker to edit loadout mods should now correctly show all picked mods.
* Selecting a different weapon masterwork tier for previewing should now correctly preview the final value of the changed stat in the masterwork picker.
* Fixed a case where the "Gift of the Lighthouse" item might be in your inventory but not show up in DIM. Allowed some items with missing names to appear in your inventory.

## 7.12.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-10)</span>

* If a wish list contains only non-enhanced perks, DIM will mark a roll as matching if it has the Enhanced versions of those perks.
* Fixed a rare edge case where Loadout Optimizer would not consider legendary armor if you own an exotic with strictly better stats.
* Glaive symbol now shows up in bounties, challenges, etc.
* `is:extraperk` filter finds weapons with additional toggleable perks, from pinnacle activities and Umbral Focusing.
* Fixed perk grouping for some perk-only wish lists.
* Armory wish list view now shows perks, magazines, barrels, etc. in a similar order to the in-game view.
* Re-added the D2Gunsmith link to the weapons armory page.
* `memento:any`, `memento:nightfall` etc. filters find crafted weapons with a memento inserted.

## 7.11.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-04-03)</span>

* The Item Popup's header now opens the Armory view when clicked, and has some cursor/link styling as a reminder.
* Deprecated Black Armory Radiance slots are now hidden, to make space for other weapon data.
* Material Counts tooltip now fits onscreen better on desktop. On mobile, it's available under the banner dropdown of the Vault inventory page.
* Wishlist combinations now collapse themselves into manageable groups in the Armory view.
* Enhanced Elemental Capacitor no longer adds all its stat bonuses to weapons on which it's selected.
* Fynch rank is now showing the correct number on the Vendors page.
* Fixed loadouts with Void 3.0 subclasses accidentally including empty fragment or aspect sockets.
* Fixed loadouts failing to remove mods from some armor or inadvertently changing the Aeon sect mod.
* Invalid search terms no longer cause the entire search to match every item.
* Searches do better with quoted strings, and allow for escaping quotes in strings (e.g. `"My \"Cool\" Loadout"`)
* Item moves are better about allowing a move if you really have space on a character, even if DIM hasn't refreshed its view of inventory. That said, DIM will always work best when its view of your inventory is up to date, so continue to refresh data after deleting items in game. DIM will now refresh automatically if we "overfill" a bucket because clearly we're out of date in that circumstance.
* Mod Picker will now properly register Shadowkeep Nightmare Mods as activity mods.
* Selected Super ability is now displayed on Void and Stasis subclass icons.
* Mod position selector avoids invalid sockets a little better.

## 7.10.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-27)</span>

* Dragging horizontally on items in Compare will scroll the list - even on iOS.
* Mobile users can now access Material Counts under the banner dropdown of the Vault inventory page.
* In the Armory and Collection views, craftable weapons now show their required Weapon Level in their tooltip.
* DIM should no longer get visually mangled by Android's auto-dark-mode.
* Fixed an incorrect item count in non-English inventory searches.
* Try a little harder to re-fetch item definitions data, if Bungie.net sends back an invalid response.
* Searches that can't be saved (because they're too long, or invalid) won't show a save â­ï¸ button.
* Search filters can contain comments. Only the top level comment gets saved. e.g. `/* My Cool Search */ is:handcannon perkname:firefly`.
* Loadouts
  * The loadout search field has been moved to the top of the loadout menu, which should prevent iOS from going crazy. Filtering loadouts hides the other buttons as well.
  * Sharing a loadout now shows an explanation of what's being shared.
  * Fixed the loadout drawer not opening when "+ Create Loadout" is selected from the vault.
  * Fixed "Fill from Equipped" going a little overboard on what it tried to add to the loadout, and spamming notifications.

## 7.9.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-20)</span>

* When loading your inventory, DIM now alerts you if your items might be misplaced, affecting your drops' Power Level.

* The Progress page properly distinguishes between +1 and +2 pinnacles.

## 7.8.3 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-15)</span>

* Fixed loadout search filter to include notes

## 7.8.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-14)</span>

* Assume armor masterwork and lock armor energy options will now be saved correctly when saving a loadout from the Loadout Optimizer and loaded correctly when Optimizing Armor.
* Obsolete consumable mods hidden in the Vault are now detected. They should show up on the Inventory page, and DIM should count vault space more accurately.
* Prevent iOS from popping up the keyboard automatically so often.
* Prevent crafting socket from showing up in the Armory.
* Clearer, prettier Enhanced Perk icons.
* Raid crafting materials are now included in the currency counter. Tap and hold, or hover, the consumables count in the vault header to check them.
* Many fixes for how classified items show up, and how they count toward the power level of each Guardian class. Can't see these fixes now, but maybe next time there's a new Raid.
* New search support for `source:vow` (Vow of the Disciple) and `source:grasp` (Grasp of Avarice) and `season:16`.

## 7.8.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2022-03-06)</span>

* The "Pull From Postmaster" button no longer requires a second tap to confirm. For those who dislike this button, it may be removed entirely via a setting in the Settings page.
* Removed D2Gunsmith link from the item details popup while they work on revamping the site for all the new changes.
* Removed the `level:` filter for D2 accounts, as Guardians no longer have a Level and items no longer require one.
* Season of the Risen War Table Upgrades are now in the right order and show their acquired status.
* Loadout Optimizer Mod picker will now correctly update when switching between mod slots without closing Mod Picker.
* Loadout Optimizer now correctly takes Echo of Persistence's class-specific stat reductions into account when generating sets.
* The "Kinetic Slot" icon in Compare sheet now looks different from the "Kinetic Damage" icon.
* Added `catalyst:` filter which accepts the following parameters `missing`, `complete`, and `incomplete`.

### Features

* `is:wishlistunknown` highlights items that have no rolls in the currently loaded wishlist.
* When you have 10 or more loadouts, a search box will appear in the Inventory page loadout dropdown, allowing you to search names just like on the Loadouts page.
* The Item Feed is available on both desktop and mobile. It shows your gear in the order it dropped, and gives you quick controls to tag incoming loot. Click on the item tile to get the full item popup.
  * Item Feed also got better at identifying relevant weapon perks.
  * Tagging an item from the Item Feed also marks it as not-new.
  * Items can be dragged out of the feed into inventory locations (or into the loadout editor).
* We have brand new Loadout Editor! Check it out from the character menu or the Loadouts page.
  * The layout mirrors the Loadout page's new design which has clear areas for different types of items. Each section also has a menu of additional actions like re-syncing from your currently equipped items, or clearing out a whole section.
  * As part of this change, we're removing support for "multi-class" loadouts. Loadouts will either be tied to one class, or can be toggled to "Any Class". "Any Class" loadouts cannot contain Subclass, Armor, or Fashion. If you edit an existing "Any Class" loadout and save it, those items will be removed unless you turn off "Any Class".
  * Double-click items to toggle between equipped and unequipped instead of single clicking. We'll be continuing to improve how you choose items and specify whether they're equipped in the future.
  * A new setting allows you to clear out all other mods from your armor when applying a loadout. This works even if you've chosen no mods in your loadout, so you can make a "Reset mods" loadout.
  * With this new design we have space to add even more loadout editing tools over the next few seasons.
  * The loadout editor stays open if you navigate to the Inventory or Loadouts screen while it's already open.
  * The new Loadout Editor is not available for D1.

### Witch Queen updates

* The Organizer page now includes a selector for Glaives.
* Glaives now show their Shield Duration stat.
* New search filters:
  * `deepsight:complete` and `deepsight:incomplete` to check the status of weapons' Deepsight attunement.
  * `deepsight:ruinous`, `deepsight:adroit`, `deepsight:mutable` and `deepsight:energetic` to identify Deepsight Resonance weapons that can provide specific Resonant Elements.
  * `is:craftable` for any weapons which could be crafted at the Relic.
  * `weaponlevel:` to filter by a crafted weapon's level.
  * `is:glaive` ... finds Glaives!
