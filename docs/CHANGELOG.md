## Next

## 6.87.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-17)</span>

* Moved "Tracked Triumphs" section to the top of the Progress page.

* Loadout Optimizer now correctly handles nightmare mods.
* Loadout Optimizer makes a better attempt at assigning mods to compared loadouts.
* Added `is:infusionfodder` search to show items where a lower-power version of the same item exists. Use `tag:junk is:infusionfodder` to check your trash for its potential to infuse!
* Loadout Optimizer will warn you if you try to load a build that's for a character class you don't have.
* If your D1 account had disappeared from DIM, it's back now.

## 6.86.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-10)</span>

* Clicking a perk in the item popup now previews the stat changes from switching to that perk.
* Clicking a perk in the Organizer view also previews the stats for that perk.
* Changes to the Armory view (bring up Armory by clicking an item's name in the item popup):

  * Armory highlights the perks rolled on the item you clicked.

* `is:maxpower` search now shows all the items at maximum power, instead of just the items that are part of your maximum power loadout. The previous meaning has been moved to `is:maxpowerloadout`. Keep in mind that because of exotics, you may not be able to equip all your max power items at once.

### Beta Only

* Loadout Optimizer now shows the maximum stat tier you can get for each stat, taking into account all of your loadout settings including min/max stats, mods, and search filter. We're still not sure of the best way to display this, so it's in Beta only for now to get some feedback.
* We've tweaked the way Loadout Optimizer chooses which subset of items to look at when you have too many items to process. We should be better at making use of items that have "spiky" stats.


## 6.85.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2021-10-03)</span>

* Postmaster and Engrams should be sorted exactly like in game now.
* Loadout Optimizer no longer saves stat min/max settings as the default for the next time you use it. Opening an existing loadout in the Optimizer will still reload the min/max settings for that loadout.

* The "Perks, Mods & Shaders" column in Organizer no longer shows the Kill Tracker socket.

* Loadout Optimizer finds better mod assignments.
* Engram power level is now also shown on hover.
* Clicking on the title of an item now brings up a new item detail page which shows all possible perks and wishlist rolls.

* Armor in Collections now shows what mod slots it has.
* Fixed vendor items showing some incorrect wishlist matches.

### Beta Only

* Removed the press-and-hold mobile item menu, which saw very limited use. This will also be removed in the release version after some time.
* Removed the "Active Mode" experiment - its ideas will come back in the future in other forms, but for now it doesn't offer enough above the Progress page (which can be opened in another tab/window next to Inventory if you want to see both).

This only works within a single piece of armor - for example, it will work if you have Powerful Friends and another Arc mod is socketed into that piece of armor, but will not yet correctly identify that the stats should be enabled when you have another Arc Charged With Light mod on *another* piece of armor.
* Masterworked Adept weapons should show all their stat bonuses.
* Fix a bug where using the move buttons instead of drag and drop wouldn't show item move progress popups or error popups.

* Banner Tweaks

## 6.42.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-12-06)</span>

* Banner Tweaks

## 6.42.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-12-06)</span>

* Farming mode now refreshes only every 30 seconds, instead of every 10 seconds, to reduce load on Bungie.net.
* When the postmaster section is collapsed, it now shows the number of items in your postmaster so you can keep an eye on it.
* Fixed an issue where the Game2Give donation banner could sometimes appear in the mobile layout.

### Beta Only

* We're trying out a new display for weapon perks, which displays the name of the active perk and shows details on click, instead of on hover. This is partly to make perks easier to understand, but also to allow for more actions on perks in the future. Let us know what you think! Animations will be added later if this design catches on.
* Continued improvements to Active mode, incorporating Bounty Guide and better suggested vendor bounties.

## 6.41.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-12-02)</span>

## 6.41.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-12-02)</span>

* Bounties and Quests sections on the Progress page now show a summary of bounties by their requirement - weapon, location, activity, and element. Click on a category to see bounties that include that category. Other categories will light up to show "synergy" categories that can be worked on while you work on the selected one. Shift-click to select multiple categories. Click the (+) on a weapon type to pull a weapon matching that type.
* New item sort option to sort sunset items last.
* Engrams show their power level - click on small engrams to see their power level in the item popup.
* The checkmark for collectibles is now on the bottom right corner, so it doesn't cover mod cost.
* Mod costs display correctly on Firefox.
* Fixed the `is:powerfulreward` search to recognize new powerful/pinnacle engrams.
* When items are classified (like the new Raid gear was for a bit), any notes added to the item will show on the tile so you can keep track of them.
* Fixed filter helper only opening the first time it is selected in the search bar
* Pinnacle/powerful rewards show a more accurate bonus, taking into account your current max power.

### Beta Only

* A new "Single character mode" can be enabled through settings, or the « icon on desktop. This focuses down to a single character, and merges your other characters' inventories into the vault (they're really still on the other characters, we're just displaying them different). This is intended for people who are focused on one character, and always shows the last played character when collapsed.

## 6.40.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-22)</span>

* Mod and mod slot info in Loadout Optimizer have been updated to handle the new mod slots better.
* Postmaster items can be dragged over any items on your character to transfer them - they don't need to be dragged to the matching item type.
* Stop showing extra +3 stats on masterwork weapons. The fix for this means that Adept weapons may not show that bonus when they are released.
* Progress page now shows more Milestones/Challenges, shows rewards for all of them, includes vendor pictures where available, and gives a hint as to what power pinnacle/powerful engrams can drop at.

## 6.39.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-16)</span>

* Farming mode will no longer immediately kick out items you manually move onto your character.

## 6.39.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-15)</span>

* Xur's location is now shown on his entry in the Vendors page.
* The Raids section is back in Progress, and Garden of Salvation shows up in Milestones.
* Search autocomplete suggests the `current` and `next` keywords for seasons.
* Reworked mod handling to account for new legacy and combat mod slots. New searches include `holdsmod:chargedwithlight`, `holdsmod:warmindcell`, etc., and `modslot:legacy` and `modslot:combatstyle`.
* Armor tiles now display the energy capacity of the armor.
* Masterwork levels in the mod details menu once again show which level masterwork they are.
* Added a new sort order for items, sort by Seasonal icon.

### Beta Only

## 6.38.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-11)</span>

* Removed character gender from tiles and notifications.
* Don't show empty archetype bar for items in collections.
* Deprecated the `sunsetsafter` search filter because its meaning is unclear. Introduced the `sunsetsin` filter and the `is:sunset` filter.
  * Try out `sunsetsin:hunt` for weapons which reached their power cap in season 11.
  * `is:sunset` won't show anything until Beyond Light launches!
* Added `current` and `next` as season names for searches. Search `sunsetsin:next` to see what'll be capped in next season even before it has an official name.
* Vendorengrams.xyz integration has been removed, because of the vendor changes in Beyond Light.
* Legacy Triumphs have been removed.
* Fixed the Progress page not loading.
* Fixed Catalysts not showing on the Records page.

* Fixed not being able to scroll on mobile.
* Fixed filter help not always showing up.

## 6.37.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-11-01)</span>

* Removed "Color Blind Mode" setting. This didn't help with DIM's accessibility - it just put a filter over the page to *simulate what it would be like* if you had various forms of color blindness.
* Added `hunt` as valid season synonym.
* Clicking on the energy track or element for armor can now let you preview how much it'd cost in total to upgrade energy or change element.

* Fixed the display of stat trackers for raid speed runs.
* Hide the "kill tracker" perk column on masterworked weapons.

* Fixed descriptions for mod effects in the Loadout Optimizer's mod picker.

* Made the item popup a bit thinner.
* Collapsing sections now animate open and closed.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with a new "Search Results" sheet that shows all the items matching your search in one place.

## 6.35.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-10-18)</span>

* Added the "sidecar" for item popup actions on desktop. This lets us have more actions, and they're easier to understand. If you always use drag and drop, you can collapse the sidecar down into a smaller version.
* On mobile, press and hold on an item to access a quick actions menu, then drag your finger to an option and release to execute it. Move items faster than ever before!
* Added buttons to the settings page to restore the default wish list URL.
* Tweaked the Loadout Optimizer to make it easier to understand, and more clearly highlight that stats can be dragged to reorder them.

* D1 items can no longer incorrectly offer the ability to pull from postmaster.
* Tuned the search autocomplete algorithm a bit to prefer shorter matches.

## 6.34.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-10-11)</span>

* Replaced the tagging dropdown with a nicer one that shows the icon and keyboard shortcut hints.
* Made the farming mode popup on mobile not overlap the category selector, and made it smaller.

* In the Organizer, the selected perk for multi-option perks is now bold.
* Updated the style and tooltip for wishlist perks to match the thumb icon shown on tiles.

* Fixed "Store" buttons not showing for items in Postmaster.
* Fixed masterwork stats for Exotics not displaying correctly.
* Fixed character stats only displaying the current character's stats on mobile.
* Fixed Postmaster not appearing on D1 for mobile.

## 6.32.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-27)</span>

* In Compare, you can click on perks to see what the new stats would look like if you chose another option.
* When the item popup is open, hitting the "c" key will open Compare.
* Your subclass has been moved below weapons and armor (it's been this way in Beta for a while).
* On mobile, instead of showing all your items at once, there's now a category selection bar that lets you quickly swap between weapons, armor, etc. The postmaster is under "inventory".
* Transferring items is just a touch snappier.
* The tag and compare button on the search bar have been replaced with a dropdown menu (three dots) with a lot more options for things you can do with the items that match your search.

* Fix masterwork tier for some items.
* Fix an issue where searching for "ote" wouldn't suggest "note:"
* The Organizer shows up in the mobile menu, but it just tells you to turn your phone.

### Beta Only

* We're experimenting with moving the item action buttons to the side of the item popup on desktop - we call it the "sidecar". It moves the actions closer to the mouse, allows room to have clearer labels, and gives more room to add more commands. Plus generally people have screens that are wider than they are tall, so this reduces the height of the popup which could previously put buttons off screen. We'll be tweaking this for a while before it launches fully.
* Beta now has an early preview of a new theme for DIM.

## 6.31.2 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-22)</span>

* Added a link to the DIM User Guide to the hamburger menu.
* "Clear new items" has been moved into the Settings page instead of being a floating button. The "X" keyboard shortcut no longer clears new items.
* Linear Fusion rifles are technically Fusion Rifles, but they won't show up in Organizer or in searches under Fusion Rifle anymore.
* While API performance is ultimately up to Bungie, we've changed things around in DIM to hopefully make item transfers snappier. Note that these changes mean you may see outdated information in DIM if you've deleted or vaulted items in-game and haven't clicked the refresh button in DIM.
* Improved the autocomplete for `sunsetsafter:` searches.
* Fix the `is:new` search.
* The D1 Activities page now shows Challenge of the Elders completion.

### Beta Only

* On mobile, there is now a bar to quickly swap between different item categories on the inventory screen.

## 6.30.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-13)</span>

* Sword-specific stats now show up in `stat:` filters.

## 6.29.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-11)</span>

* Improved performance of item transfers. We're still limited by how fast Bungie.net's API can go, though.
* Fixed a couple of the legacy triumphs that indicated the wrong triumph was being retired.
* Completed legacy triumph categories, and collections categories, now show the "completed" yellow background.
* is:seasonaldupe now correctly pays attention to the season of the item.
* Fixed a bug where notes wouldn't be saved if you clicked another item before dismissing the item popup.

## 6.29.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-09-10)</span>

* Triumphs, Collections, and Stat Trackers are now all together in the new Records page.
* You can track triumphs in DIM - tracked triumphs are stored and synced with DIM Sync. These show up on both the Progress and Records pages.
* Everything on the Records page responds to search - search through your Collections, Triumphs, and Stat Trackers all at once!
* Unredeemed triumphs show their rewards
* Compare sheet now offers a Base Stat option for armor, so you can directly compare your stat rolls
* Mod costs now shown in Loadout Optimizer results
* Vendors can now track some "pluggable" items like emotes & ghost projections, to filter by whether you already own them
* Clearing the search input no longer re-opens the search dropdown

## 6.27.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-30)</span>

* The new armor 2.0 mod workflow is available in the Loadout Optimizer, this includes:
  * A new Mod Picker component to let you choose armor 2.0 mods to lock.
  * The mod sockets shown in the optimiser are now the locked mods, rather than the mods currently equipped on the item.
  * Clicking on a mod socket will open the picker to show available mods for that slot. Note that locking a mod from this won't guarantee it gets locked to the item specifically.
  * Items have different levels of grouping depending on the requirements of the locked mods. Locking no mods keeps the previous grouping behaviour.
  * The mods stat contributions are now shown in the picker.
  * The Mod Picker can now filter for items from a specific season, just filter by the season number directly e.g. "11" for arrivals.
* The search bar now remembers your past searches and allows you to save your favorite searches. These saved and recent searches are synced between devices using DIM Sync.
* The quick item picker (plus icon) menu no longer has an option to equip the selected item. Instead it will always just move the item - very few users selected "Equip" and it won't ever work in game activities.
* Added background colors for items and characters before their images load in, which should reduce the "pop-in" effect.
* Shaders can be tagged from the Collections page and the tags/notes show up there as well.
* Shift+Click on the Notes field in Organizer while in edit mode no longer applies a search.
* For pages with sidebars (like Progress), scrollbars appearing will no longer cover content.
* Add character stats to loadout sheet if full armor set is added.

## 6.26.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-23)</span>

* Better touchscreen support for drag and drop.
* Wishlists now support Github gists (raw text URLs), so there's no need to set up an entire repository to host them. If you are making wishlists, you can try out changes easier than ever. If you're not making wishlists, hopefully you're using them. If you don't know what wishlists are, [here you go](https://destinyitemmanager.fandom.com/wiki/Wish_Lists)
* Engrams get a more form-fitting outline on mouse hover.
* If you have a search query active, DIM will not automatically reload to update itself.
* The `is:curated` search has been overhauled to better find curated rolls.
* Fixes to how the character headers look in different browsers.

* Mobile - changes in DIM beta only: different parts of the header now stick with you as you scroll down.

## 6.24.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-12)</span>

* Updated the character tiles, now uses triple dot instead of chevron
* Solstice of Heroes is back and so is the **Solstice of Heroes** section of the **Progress** tab. Check it out and view your progress toward upgrading armor.

## 6.24.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-09)</span>

* Configure a custom armor stat per-class in Settings, and it'll show up in item popups, Organizer, Compare, and the new `stat:custom:` search.

* `is:smg` for if you're as bad at remembering "submachine gun" as.. some of us are.

* Seasonal Artifact is now previewable, but be warned:

  * It can show seasonal mods you have equipped, but Season 11 mods still aren't in Collections data, so mod unlocks aren't displayed.
* Spreadsheet columns slightly adjusted to get them back to their usual column names.
* Lots going on behind the scenes to clear up errors and get Loadout Optimizer ready for upgrades!

## 6.23.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-08-02)</span>

* You can add tags and notes to shaders! Keep track of your favorites and which shaders you could do without.
* Searches now support parentheses for grouping, the "and" keyword, and the "not" keyword. Example: `(is:weapon and is:sniperrifle) or not (is:armor and modslot:arrival)`. "and" has higher precedence than "or", which has higher precedence than just a space (which still means "and").
* Fixed the size of damage type icons in D1.
* Our Content Security Policy is more restrictive now, external and injected scripts may fail but this keeps your account and data safer.

## 6.22.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-07-27)</span>

* Fix a crash with the Twitch gift sub shader.

## 6.17.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-28)</span>

## 6.15.1 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-15)</span>

## 6.15.0 <span class="changelog-date">(2020-06-14)</span>

* Introducing [DIM Sync](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/wiki/DIM-Sync-(new-storage-for-tags,-loadouts,-and-settings)), a brand new way for DIM to store your loadouts and tags and sync them between all your devices.
