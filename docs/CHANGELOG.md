* Xur should disappear on Sundays again.

# 3.16.1

* Significantly increased the storage limit for tags and notes. It's still possible to go over (especially with long notes) but it should happen far less frequently - and it should notify you when it happens.

# 3.16.0

* Removed farming option to keep greens since they're disassembled by default now.
* Added stat search, for example: "stat:rof:>= 22"
* Fixed formatting for search loadouts when the search terms contain angle brackets.
* A new "Make room for Postmaster items" auto layout will clear out enough space on your character to pick up all the stuff you've accumulated at the Postmaster.

* Clicking the title of an item in the compare tool will scroll to that item and "pop" it so you know which one it is.

# 3.15.0

* Permit the same damage type of subclass in loadouts (#1067)
* Update record books to properly display time instead of a large number. (#1051)
* Moving an item into a full vault but an empty bucket (such as full General but the vault contains no Consumables) now works.
* Stacks of items are properly accounted for. They'll now combine as things are moved to make space - previously even a stack of 1 consumable would count as taking up the whole slot and would prevent a move of 2 more of that consumable.
* We now catch errors trying to move aside items and retry with a different item. You should see fewer failed moves!
* "Thrashing" in farming mode is fixed. When farming mode can't proceed (because moving anything off the character would result in something else being moved back on, because you're out of space), we now show a friendly info message. This message is throttled to show up no more than once a minute.
* Fixed a bug where a full vault would prevent farming mode from moving things to other characters.
* The move aside logic strongly prefers putting things on characters other than the original item's owner. This makes it much easier to move a bunch of stuff off of a character without other things bouncing right back in.
* Prefer putting engrams in the vault and not taking them out when choosing items to move aside.
* Farming mode now makes room to pick up artifacts, materials, and consumables.
* When making space in the "General" category or in Materials/Consumables buckets, we'll choose to move aside an item that can be combined with another stack somewhere without increasing the total number of stacks. This trends towards consolidation and can help free up a full vault, as well as getting rid of stray stacks.
* We swapped in "special ammo synth" and "primary ammo synth" instead of "motes of light" and "strange coins" for the farming mode quick gather buttons. They seemed more useful in the heat of battle.
* When dequipping an item, we try harder to find a good item to equip in its place. We also prefer replacing exotics with other exotics, and correctly handle The Life Exotic perk.
* Lots of new translations and localized strings.
* Vendors update when you reach a new level in their associated faction, or when you change faction alignment.
* Fixed a too-small perk selection box in the loadout builder, and properly handle when vendors are selling Memory of Felwinter.

* Added a new "Item Leveling" auto-loadout. This loadout finds items for you to dump XP into. It strongly favors locked items, and won't replace an incomplete item that you have equipped. Otherwise, it goes after items that already have the most XP (closest to completion), preferring exotics and legendaries if they are locked, and rares and legendaries if they're not locked (because you get more materials out of disassembling them that way).

* Fix a bug where having items in the postmaster would confuse moves of the same item elsewhere.
* Fix a bug where item comparisons no longer worked.
* Added support for the classified shader "Walkabout".

# 3.5.1

* The Infusion Calculator has been removed, now that infusions are much more straightforward.
* Pressing the "i" key on the keyboard will toggle showing item details in the item popup.
* Add a menu item for when Xur is in town. This brings up a panel with Xur's wares, how much everything costs, how many strange coins you have, and lets you show the item details popup plus compare against any version of exotics you might already have to see if there's a better roll.

# 3.5

* DIM will now go to great lengths to make sure your transfer will succeed, even if your target's inventory is full, or the vault is full. It does this by moving stuff aside to make space, automatically.
* Fixed a bug that would cause applying loadouts to fill up the vault and then fail.
* Fixed a bug where DIM would refuse to equip an exotic when dequipping something else, even if the exotic was OK to equip.
* When applying a loadout, DIM will now equip and dequip loadout items all at once, in order to speed up applying the loadout.
* The search box has a new style.
* Item moves and loadouts will now wait for each other, to prevent errors when they would collide. This means if you apply two loadouts, the second will wait for the first to complete before starting.
* Item details are now toggled by clicking the "i" icon on the item popup, rather than just by hovering over it.

# 3.4.1

* Bugfix to address an infinite loop while moving emotes.

# 3.4.0

* Moving and equipping items, especially many at a time (loadouts) is faster.
* When you save a loadout, it is now scoped to the platform it's created on, rather than applying across accounts. Loadouts created on one account used to show on both accounts, but wouldn't work on the wrong account.
* You can now move partial amounts of materials. There's a slider in the move popup, and holding "shift" or hovering over the drop area will pop up a dialog for draggers. You can choose to move more than one stack's worth of an item, up to the total amount on a character.
* New commands for materials to consolidate (move them all to this character) and distribute (divide evenly between all characters).
* Loadouts can now contain materials and consumables. Add or remove 5 at a time by holding shift while clicking. When the loadout is applied, we'll make sure your character has *at least* that much of the consumable.
* Loadouts can now contain 10 weapons or armor of a single type, not just 9.
* When making space for a loadout, we'll prefer putting extra stuff in the vault rather than putting it on other characters. We'll also prefer moving aside non-equipped items of low rarity and light level.
* The is:engram search filter actually works.
* Fixed an error where DIM would not replace an equipped item with an instance of the same item hash. This would cause an error with loadouts and moving items. [448](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/448)
* Loadouts can now display more than one line of items, for you mega-loadout lovers.
* Items in the loadout editor are sorted according to your sort preference.

# 3.3.3

* Infusion calculator performance enhancements
* Larger lock icon
* Completed segments of Intelligence, Discipline, and Strength are now colored orange.

# 3.3.2

* If multiple items in the infusion calculator have the same light, but different XP completion percentage, favor suggesting the item with the least XP for infusion.
* Keyword search also searches perks on items.
* New search terms for is:engram, is:sword, is:artifact, is:ghost, is:consumable, is:material, etc.
* Items can be locked and unlocked by clicking the log icon next to their name.
* Display intellect/discipline/strength bars and cooldown for each character
* Loadouts have a "Save as New" button which will let you save your modified loadout as a new loadout without changing the loadout you started editing.
* Autocomplete for search filters.
* Comparing stats for armor now shows red and green better/worse bars correctly.
* Fixed showing magazine stat for weapons in the vault.
* Fixed infusion material cost for Ghosts and Artifacts (they cost motes of light).
* Fix a case where the item properties popup may be cut off above the top of the screen.
* Transfer/equip/dequip actions for edge cases will now succeed as expected without errors.
* Manifest file update.

# 3.3.1

* Updated the manifest file.

# 3.3

* Infusion auto calculator is much faster.
* Items in the infusion calculator don't grey out when a search is active anymore.
* Full cost of infusions is now shown, including exotic shards, weapon parts / armor materials, and glimmer.
* Show a better error message when trying to equip an item for the wrong class. Before it would say you weren't experienced enough.
* Add a button to the infusion calculator that moves the planned items to your character.
* Add a filter to the infusion calculator to limit the search to only rare (blue) items.
* The infusion auto calculator runs automatically, and now presents a list of different attack/defense values for you to choose from. Selecting one will show the best path to get to that light level.
* The infusion calculator greys out items that are already used or are too low light to use, rather than hiding them.
* The item move popup now has an entry for the infusion calculator, to make it easier to find.
* Hold Shift and click on items in the infusion calculator to prevent the calculator from using that item.
* If you have an exotic class item (with "The Life Exotic" perk) equipped, you can now equip another exotic without having the class item get automatically de-equipped. Previously, this worked only if you equipped the non-class-item exotic first.
* Armor, Artifacts, and Ghosts now show the difference in stats with your currently equipped item. Also, magazine/energy between swords and other heavy weapons compares correctly.
* The is:complete, is:incomplete, is:upgraded, is:xpincomplete, and is:xpcomplete search keywords all work again, and their meanings have been tweaked so they are all useful.
* The talent grid for an item are now shown in the item details, just like in the game, including XP per node.
* Subclasses show a talent grid as well!
* The item stats comparison will no longer be cleared if DIM reloads items while an item popup is open.
* Bounties and quests are now separated, and under their own "Progress" heading.
* Bounties, quests, and anything else that can have objectives (like test weapons and runes) now show their objectives and the progress towards them. As a result, completion percentages are also now accurate for those items.
* Descriptions are now shown for all items.
* Include hidden stats "Aim Assist" and "Equip Speed" for all weapons. You can still see all hidden stats by visiting DTR via the link at the top of item details.
* Weapon types are now included in their popup title.
* Removed Crimson Days theme.  It will return.
* Fixed issue at starts up when DIM cannot resolve if the user is logged into Bungie.net.

# 3.2.2

* Updated Crimson Days Theme.

# 3.2.1

* Crimson Days theme.
* Weapons and armor now show all activated perks (including scopes, etc), in the same order they are shown in the game.
* Only display the "more info" detail icon if there's something to show.
* If you try to move an item into a full inventory, we'll reload to see if you've already made space in the game, rather than failing the move immediately.
* The Infusion dialog now has a "Maximize Attack/Defense" button that figures out how to get the highest stats with the fewest number of infusions.
* You can now create a loadout based on what you've got equipped by selecting "From Equipped" in the "Create Loadout" menu item.
* After applying a loadout, a new pseudo-loadout called "Before 'Your Loadout'" appears that will put back the items you had equipped.

# 3.2

* In the "Loadouts" dropdown is a new "Maximize Light" auto-loadout that does what it says, pulling items from all your characters and the vault in order to maximize your character's light.
* Lots of performance improvements! Loading DIM, refreshing, moving items, and searching should all be faster.
* DIM will now refresh immediately when you switch back to its tab, or come back from screensaver, etc. It won't automatically update when it's in the background anymore. It still periodically updates itself when it is the focused tab.
* New "is:year1" and "is:year2" search filters.
* Artifacts now have the right class type (hunter, titan, etc).
* The reload and settings icons are easier to hit (remember you can also hit "R" to reload.
* The move popup closes immediately when you select a move, rather than waiting for the move to start.
* New sort option of "rarity, then primary stat".
